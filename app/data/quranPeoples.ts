// Peoples & Nations — dataset types + data (Phase 2 of
// quranic_knowledge_platform_phased_plan.md; see MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md's
// "Qur'anic Knowledge Platform — Shared Foundation" section for the
// conventions this file follows). Builds on Module 17 (Prophets & Qur'anic
// Persons) rather than duplicating it: individuals and small, individually-
// flavored groups directly embedded in one narrative stay in that module
// (People & Groups) — this file is for larger COLLECTIVE populations
// (an entire tribe/nation/community/religious-community), generally with
// their own place, era, and a stated collective outcome, often spanning
// several narratives/generations rather than one bounded story.
//
// Boundary decision (documented per the phased plan's explicit
// instruction, not made casually): the 7 existing People & Groups entries
// with `entityType: "group"` (People of the Cave, People of the Trench,
// Companions of the Elephant, Hawariyyun, Pharaoh's Magicians, Yusuf's
// Brothers, The Two Men of the Gardens) were re-examined against this
// module and NONE were migrated. Every one of them is a small, individually
// -flavored cast bounded to one narrative (often with recorded group
// dialogue/action), not a civilizational/tribal/national population with
// its own independent identity across the Qur'an — the defining trait of
// every entity below. No overlap, no duplication.
//
// Verification: every entity's core Qur'anic term was checked against this
// app's live Quran search API (alquran.cloud) at authoring time. Several
// short/common Arabic roots used for these terms (e.g. "عاد," "سبأ,"
// "مدين") returned heavily contaminated substring matches (root/letter
// overlap with unrelated words — "مدين" is literally a substring of
// "المدينة," for example) that Phase 1's whole-word normalizer was built
// for but this file does not reproduce. Where the API result was clean
// (a distinctive multi-word or low-collision phrase), `directMentions`
// reflects it directly; where it was contaminated, `directMentions` is a
// smaller, manually-verified, high-confidence anchor set rather than a
// claimed-exhaustive list — this module's `directMentions` should be read
// as curated representative citations, NOT the exhaustive-per-ayah standard
// Module 17 achieved. Each entity's `relatedPassages` carries the
// substantive narrative citation either way, per this app's established
// Direct-Mentions-vs-Related-Passages discipline.
