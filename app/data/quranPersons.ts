// Prophets & Qur'anic Persons — dataset types + data.
// See prophets-quran-feature.md for the full product spec this implements
// (Phase 1-5 UI/integration work is complete — see MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md
// Module 17). This file is the CONTENT layer: prophets, named/title-based
// HUMAN figures, and significant HUMAN groups mentioned in the Qur'an — 56
// entries (the 25 traditionally named prophets, 24 other named/title-based
// individuals, and 7 collectively-significant groups), each verified
// against this app's own live Quran search API (alquran.cloud, Arabic
// `quran-simple` edition) at authoring time.
//
// Coverage-audit expansion (56th entry onward from the original 38): a
// systematic pass identified individuals the Qur'an clearly identifies by
// role even without a personal name (Al-Khidr, Pharaoh's wife, the
// believing man of Pharaoh's family, etc. — `personType: "title_based_person"`,
// same convention already used for Dhul-Qarnayn/Bilqis/Uzair) and
// collectively-named groups where the Qur'an itself does not give
// individual members' names (People of the Cave, People of the Trench,
// etc. — `entityType: "group"`, `personType: "quranic_group"`). See this
// file's own additions below for the per-entry source-separation notes, and
// the "Qur'anic Persons — Comprehensive Coverage Audit & Dataset Expansion"
// report for the full candidate table (entries added, and — just as
// deliberately — entries considered and excluded).
//
// This is still NOT a claim of covering every individual or group mentioned
// in the Qur'an. Known, deliberate exclusions (see the audit report for the
// full reasoning on each):
//   - Generic/incidental unnamed people with no distinct individual role,
//     and whole peoples/nations (e.g. 'Ad, Thamud, the People of Saba' as a
//     nation) — the latter belong to a possible future "Peoples &
//     Communities" taxonomy, not this Persons/Figures & Groups feature.
//   - Named NON-HUMAN beings (the angels Harut and Marut, 2:102; Iblis) are
//     out of scope — this feature is scoped to human Qur'anic persons.
//   - 'Imran is a deliberate omission, not an oversight: his name occurs
//     only in genitive/possessive constructions ("family of 'Imran," "wife
//     of 'Imran," "Maryam, daughter of 'Imran") with no independent
//     narrative or action attributed to him, so he has no person-focused
//     role for this feature to build a profile around. The same reasoning
//     is why Al-'Aziz of Egypt and his wife (Surah Yusuf) are not
//     included in this pass — significant to Yusuf's narrative, but a
//     secondary supporting role rather than a distinct arc of their own;
//     flagged as a future-candidate, not silently dropped.
//
// Verification method (see MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md for the full write-up):
// the search API does root/substring matching, not whole-word matching, so
// every raw result was passed through a whole-word normalizer (stripping
// tashkeel, unifying alef/ya/ta-marbuta forms, accounting for common
// single-letter prefixes and the accusative-case trailing alef) and then,
// for any name that could also be a common Arabic word — "Hud" (also
// "Jewish"), "Salih" (also the adjective "righteous"), "Yahya" (also the
// verb "gives life"), "Zayd" (also a common verb root meaning "increase")
// — every remaining match was read in full and hand-classified, since
// automated whole-word matching cannot distinguish true homographs.
// `directMentions` below reflects the verified result: EVERY ayah where the
// person's name/title is explicitly present, not a curated subset — see
// MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md Module 17 for the full audit report (counts
// before/after, rejected false positives, etc.).

The Qur'an refers to her only via pronouns and titles ('a woman ruling them,' 'she who has a great throne'). The name comes from traditional/tafsir literature, not the Qur'an text. Because of this, `directMentions` is correctly empty for her — she has a Related Passage (her story) but no Direct Mentions (her name/title as such is never used), which is exactly the distinction this feature is built to preserve, not a data-entry gap.",

So 'Sheba' as a place is Qur'an-supported, while 'Queen of Sheba' as her specific title/epithet, like 'Bilqis,' is a traditional convention (also found in the Bible, 1 Kings 10) layered onto that place-name, not a Qur'anic statement.",

      "The Qur'an does not name this king. `directMentions` is empty because 'الملك' ('the king'/'the sovereign') is a generic word used throughout the Qur'an in many unrelated contexts, not a designation unique to him within Surah Yusuf, so it is not listed as if it were a verified unique reference — his scenes are instead captured through the curated Related Passages above.",
      "This entry is distinct from Yusuf's own later position of authority — after his appointment, Yusuf himself is addressed by the title 'Al-'Aziz' (12:78, 12:88), not 'Al-Malik'; the two titles and the two roles are not conflated here.",
