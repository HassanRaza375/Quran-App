# Wajibat Module — Progress Log

Running log for Module 18 (Wajibat & Daily Fiqh, Ja'fari, route `/fiqh`).
Spec: `wajibat-fiqh-jafari-module.md` · Decisions: `wajibat_decisions.md` (decisions win when the two disagree).
Each topic dataset gets a §13.1 topic summary, and each phase gets a §13.2 completion report.

---

## Phase 0 — Inspection & architecture — Completion Report (2026-09-25)

### What was inspected
- `package.json`, `nuxt.config.ts`: UI kit, fonts, head links
- `app/pages/poets/[slug].vue` and `app/pages/commands/[id].vue`: the most recently built pages (Q5)
- `app/components/layout/LayoutNavigationDrawer.vue`: sidebar structure
- `app/stores/prayer.js`, `app/utils/prayerFiqh.js`: how `prayer.fiqh` is stored and read
- `app/pages/settings.vue`: the fiqh toggle, the "Additional Modules" switch, export and wipe
- `app/plugins/storage.client.js`: the `$storage` wrapper
- `app/pages/bookmarks.vue`: tab and namespace structure
- `app/components/persons/AyahReferenceCard.vue`: props
- `app/utils/quranReference.ts`: shared Qur'an-citation types
- `app/data/quranCommands.ts`: the Qur'anic-text Commands layer and its id style
- `app/composables/usePoetModules.ts`: the latest example of a stateful composable
- `MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md`: Module Index, Shared Foundation, Module 17, Cross-Module Conventions
- The official websites of all three maraji'. The full source table is in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### What was built / changed
No feature code was written in this phase (per spec).

### Files created / changed
- `wajibat_decisions.md`: filled in the Phase 0 findings (Q5, the official source table) and added pending questions P1–P4
- `wajibat_progress_log.md`: created (this file)
- `CLAUDE.md`: added a one-line pointer to the spec, the decisions file, and this log
- `MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md`: added the Module 18 row to the index and a stub Module 18 section

### Content added
None. Content starts in Phase 1.

### Sources used (reachability checked 2026-09-25)
- **Sistani:** *Islamic Laws*, 4th ed. (English, "Ruling n") and *توضیح المسائل* (Urdu). Both the pages and the PDFs load. ✅
- **Khamenei:** *Practical Laws of Islam* (English Q&A, "Q n"), *The Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* (numbered), and *استفتاآت کے جوابات* (Urdu), all on leader.ir. They load. ✅
- **Makarem Shirazi:** the official site loads, but no English or Urdu risala text could be reached. The announced PDF returns 404, the ahkam portal returns 404/403, and the TOC is rendered with JavaScript. ❌ See pending question P1.

### Architecture decisions (and why)
1. **UI kit: Vuetify 3** (Q5). Evidence is in `wajibat_decisions.md`.
2. **Shared types:** `QuranReference`, `SourceType` and `SourceReference` were **already extracted** to
   `app/utils/quranReference.ts` (Knowledge Platform Phase 2). Nothing needs extracting now.
   `WajibatTopic.quranicBasis` imports `QuranReference` from there.
3. **Separate verification vocabulary.** The `A | B | D` levels and `RulingBasis`
   (`fatwa | ihtiyat_wajib | ihtiyat_mustahab`) measure *which authority a fiqh ruling rests on*.
   The existing Knowledge Platform scales measure *how certain a Qur'anic/historical identification is*.
   This follows the precedent `quranCommands.ts` set with `CommandSourceBasis`: define a separate,
   module-local type rather than overload `SourceType` or `IdentificationBasis`, whose values already
   carry meaning in other modules. Shared Foundation #5 ("don't invent a near-duplicate scale") isn't
   violated, because this is a different axis and the spec (§5) requires these exact levels.
4. **Id style:** Shared Foundation #1 says entity ids are lowercase ASCII with **no hyphens**
   (e.g. `prayercommand`). Wajibat follows that for entity ids (`wudu`, `ghusljanabat`,
   `mubtilatsalat`), which differs from the spec's §7.1 proposal of hyphenated slugs. Ids double as
   URL segments, so routes look like `/fiqh/taharat/ghusljanabat`.
5. **Data layout:** `app/data/wajibat/` is a folder split by category (spec §10), not the single
   `app/data/quranX.ts` file that other modules use. The dataset will be much larger, and spec
   Phase 10 requires lazy loading per category.
6. **Routes:** `app/pages/persons/timeline.vue` already sits beside `persons/[id].vue` and wins
   (vue-router ranks static segments above dynamic ones). `/fiqh/glossary` and `/fiqh/choose-marja`
   next to `/fiqh/[category]/` rely on the same behaviour. This will be re-checked in the browser in Phase 1.
7. **Marja' preference persistence:** `useFiqhPrefs` stores `quran:fiqh-prefs:v1` through
   `$storage` with the same load/persist shape as `usePoetModules.ts`. Settings → export and wipe
   (`settings.vue` `exportData`/`clearAllData`) dump and clear **all** of `localStorage`, so the new
   key is included **automatically**. No change is needed there.
8. **Fiqh setting:** `usePrayerStore().fiqh` (`"sunni" | "jafari"`, legacy raw key `prayerFiqh`)
   stays the only source of truth. The Settings marja' selector goes under the existing fiqh toggle
   and appears only when `fiqh === "jafari"`.
9. **Bookmarks:** `bookmarks.vue` defines a fixed tab list and filters each tab with
   `startsWith("{type}:")`. A "Fiqh" tab filtering on `fiqh:` is a purely additive change. The key is
   `fiqh:{topicId}`, stored through `useBookmarks().toggle()`.
10. **Qur'anic basis cards:** `AyahReferenceCard` takes one ayah (`surahNo`, `ayahNo`). A range
    such as 5:6 on its own is fine, but a multi-ayah basis renders one card per ayah, the same way
    other modules do it.
11. **Separation from Commands (Knowledge Platform Phase 9):** `/commands` is the Qur'anic-text layer.
    `/fiqh` is the marja'-ruling layer. There are no shared data files. Cross-links are left to the
    Phase 10 Knowledge Graph.

### Adjustments to the spec's §7.1 data model
- Entity ids have no hyphens (decision 4).
- `quranicBasis?: QuranReference[]` imports from `app/utils/quranReference.ts`.
- Everything else in §7.1 stands as proposed until Phase 1 implementation shows otherwise. Any change will be reported.

### Shared patterns reused / created
Reused: `$storage`, the `useState` composable pattern, `useBookmarks.toggle`, `AyahReferenceCard`,
`quranReference.ts`, the `{module}Validate.ts` + `tests/{module}Dataset.test.ts` pattern, and the
Module 17 accessibility patterns. Created: none yet.

### Tests / Lint / Build
Not run. Phase 0 changed only documentation.

### Browser verification / Regression
Not run. No UI changed.

### Known issues
- The sidebar has no "Worship" group (P3).
- The Noto Nastaliq Urdu font isn't loaded anywhere in the app (P4).

### Unsourced items left out
All of Makarem Shirazi's rulings, until P1 is resolved.

### Open questions for the user
P1–P4 in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### Recommended next phase
Phase 1 (Foundation) can start once P1–P4 are answered. P1 blocks only Makarem Shirazi content,
not the Phase 1 code. P3 and P4 are needed for the shell UI.

---

### Phase 1 · Taqlid — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added, per marja': Sistani 11 · Khamenei 6 · Makarem Shirazi 0 (A: 17, B: 0, D: 0)
- Procedures / decision trees added: none (none needed for this topic)
- Sources used: Sistani, *Islamic Laws* 4th ed., Rulings 1–4 and 6–9, plus 12* (https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2117/); Urdu *توضیح المسائل* masa'il 1–12, same numbers (https://www.sistani.org/urdu/book/61/3332/). Khamenei, *Practical Laws of Islam* Q 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13 (leader.ir `sn=5238`, `sn=5239`); Urdu *استفتاآت کے جوابات* س 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13, same numbers in this chapter (`sn=11366`, `sn=11367`).
- Differences between maraji' flagged: none. Each marja's entry is shown on its own, and nothing is compared or merged.
- Unsourced / needs research: Khamenei has no entry yet for *following the aʿlam*, *identifying a mujtahid*, *obtaining a fatwa*, *recommended precaution* or *death of the marja'*. His Q&A book covers some of these; they were left out, not guessed. Q 16 (aʿlam) is held back, see P5.
- Questions for the user: P5.

### Phase 1 · Ahkam (the five rulings) — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 1 · Khamenei 0 · Makarem 0 (A: 1)
- Sources used: Sistani, *Islamic Laws* Ruling 12*, closing paragraph on doing acts *rajāʾan* (English only; this paragraph is not in the Urdu مسئلہ ۱۲). The five definitions are app-written explanation, and the glossary definitions are quoted from *Islamic Laws*' Glossary.
- Unsourced / needs research: a Khamenei ruling on this topic.

### Phase 1 · Usul al-Din (overview) — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 1 · Khamenei 1 · Makarem 0 (A: 2)
- Sources used: Sistani, Ruling 1 (first paragraph; Urdu مسئلہ ۱). Khamenei, Q1312 (`sn=5204`); Urdu **س1321** (`sn=23170`). The Urdu Q number differs from the English one, and each is cited with its own number (R1).
- The list of the five usul is app-written explanation.

### Phase 1 · Furu' al-Din (overview) — 2026-09-25
- Explanation only (the list of the ten furu'). No rulings.

### Phase 1 · Bulugh — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 3 · Khamenei 3 · Makarem 0 (A: 6)
- Sources used:
  - Sistani, Ruling 2270* excerpt and 2271* (https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2355/), plus Ruling 434 (`/2171/`); Urdu مسئلہ ۲۲۷۰ excerpt (https://www.sistani.org/urdu/book/61/3648/).
  - Khamenei, Q1871, Q1873 and Q1878 (`sn=5232`); Urdu س 1887, س 1889 and س 1894 (`sn=23199`).
- **Edition difference found (see P6):** the English 4th edition revised Rulings 2270 and 2271 (marked *). The official Urdu مسئلہ ۲۲۷۱ still says facial hair is "بعید نہیں کہ بلوغت کی علامت ہو" (not unlikely to be a sign). The revised English says it *is* a sign. The Urdu is therefore **not** shown for 2271. For 2270, the excerpt used (the signs themselves) matches between the two; another part of 2270 does differ, and it is not shown.
- The women-specific ruling (bleeding before nine) is inside a collapsed panel (Q8).
- English only, no official Urdu shown: Sistani 2271* (edition difference) and 434 (the Urdu مسئلہ was not found in the chapter page fetched).
- Unsourced: Sistani has no separate entry for "lunar or solar years" (his Ruling 2270 does say "lunar years"; this is visible under *Signs of bulugh*). Khamenei has no entry for facial hair.

## Phase 1 — Foundation — Completion Report (2026-09-25)

### What was inspected
Everything from Phase 0, plus: the useBookmarks API and the `/bookmarks` tab structure, the Settings fiqh block, the prayer store's `loadFiqh`/`init` (runs in the default layout on the client), the poet pages' existing Urdu styling, the PWA `globPatterns`, and the vitest/eslint setup.

### What was built / changed
- **Data layer** (`app/data/wajibat/`): types, the three maraji', 9 categories, 5 Foundations topics, 17 rulings (26 per-marja' entries) and 19 glossary terms.
- **Pure logic and tests:** validator, search and coverage helpers, with three test files (24 tests).
- **Marja' preference:** `useFiqhPrefs` (key `quran:fiqh-prefs:v1`, `{marjaId, lang, updatedAt}`), a first-visit picker (inline on the hub and topic pages, and at `/fiqh/choose-marja`), and a Settings selector shown only when fiqh = Ja'fari.
- **Components** (`app/components/wajibat/`): HukmBadge, BasisBadge (ihtiyat tooltip), SourceLine, RulingCard (never falls back to another marja'), ExplanationBlock (dashed and italic, labelled "written by the app, not a ruling"), MarjaChip, MarjaPicker, FiqhNotices (Sunni banner and "Not scholar-reviewed"), FiqhDisclaimer, LangToggle (English / اردو / Both).
- **Pages:** `/fiqh` (hub, search, categories), `/fiqh/[category]` (topics, or a "scheduled for phase N" empty state), `/fiqh/[category]/[topic]`, `/fiqh/glossary`, `/fiqh/choose-marja`.
- **Integration:** a sidebar entry above Prayer Times (P3), a `/bookmarks` "Fiqh" tab (`fiqh:{topicId}`), and the Urdu font on `/fiqh/**` and `/poets/**` (P4).

### How the ruling texts were produced (anti-hallucination)
No ruling text was typed or translated by hand. The official pages were downloaded (sistani.org HTML and the 4th-edition PDF, and the leader.ir English and Urdu Q&A books), and a script cut each excerpt out verbatim from them. The script **fails if any excerpt isn't found** in its source. Only footnote markers like `[3]` were removed; the translator's own `[i.e. …]` glosses were kept. The glossary was produced the same way from *Islamic Laws*' Glossary. The generator scripts and downloaded pages stayed in the session scratchpad and are not in the repo (they're third-party pages). To re-verify, re-open the cited URL; every entry carries it.

### Files created / changed
- Created:
  - `app/data/wajibat/{types,marja,categories,topics,glossary,index}.ts` and `app/data/wajibat/rulings/foundations.ts`
  - `app/utils/{wajibatValidate,wajibatSearch,wajibatCoverage,wajibatLabels}.ts`
  - `app/composables/{useFiqhPrefs,useWajibat,useUrduFont}.ts`
  - `app/components/wajibat/*.vue` (10 files)
  - `app/pages/fiqh/{index,glossary,choose-marja}.vue` and `app/pages/fiqh/[category]/{index,[topic]}.vue`
  - `tests/wajibat{Dataset,Search,Coverage}.test.ts`
- Changed:
  - `app/pages/settings.vue` (marja' select)
  - `app/pages/bookmarks.vue` (Fiqh tab)
  - `app/components/layout/LayoutNavigationDrawer.vue` (entry)
  - `app/pages/poets/[slug].vue` and `app/pages/poets/index.vue` (Nastaliq font)
  - `app/assets/css/main.css` (`.urdu-text` / `.urdu-inline`)
  - `package.json` (+`@fontsource/noto-nastaliq-urdu`)
  - `wajibat_decisions.md`, `MODULE_BLUEPRINT.md`, this log

### Content added
| Topic | Rulings | Sistani (A) | Khamenei (A) | Makarem | Sistani with Urdu | Khamenei with Urdu |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Taqlid | 11 | 11 | 6 | 0 | 11 | 6 |
| Ahkam | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — |
| Usul al-Din | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Furu' al-Din | 0 (explanation only) | — | — | — | — | — |
| Bulugh | 4 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| **Total** | **17** | **16** | **10** | **0** | **13** | **10** |

Every entry is level A. There are no level-B or level-D entries.

### Architecture decisions (and why)
1. **`MarjaRuling` changes from spec §7.1:**
   - `hukm` is **optional**. It is set only where the source states it (e.g. "it is obligatory…"); most taqlid rulings are conditions, not one of the five ahkam, and inferring one would breach §4.4.
   - Added `format: "issue" | "qa"` and `question` for Khamenei's Q&A.
   - Added `urSource`, because the Urdu books number rulings differently from the English books (Khamenei's English Q1312 is Urdu س1321).
   - Added `excerpt` (true when only part of a numbered ruling is quoted) and `urduNote`.
2. `Ruling.sensitive` renders a ruling inside the collapsed women-specific panel (Q8). This is per ruling, not per topic, so the rest of the Bulugh topic stays open.
3. `Marja.status: "pending-sources"` covers Makarem Shirazi: he stays selectable (P1), the validator forbids adding rulings for him until his sources exist, and the UI shows the "being added" notice on every ruling.
4. **The validator enforces the source rules:** a level-A URL must be on the marja's own official site; Urdu text needs an Urdu citation on the official site; a marja' may not appear twice in one ruling; D requires `disputed`; ids must be hyphen-free.
5. **Urdu font:** `useUrduFont()` registers **only the woff2 file of the Arabic-script subset** through the FontFace API, on the pages that call it. Importing fontsource's CSS would have bundled both woff and woff2.
6. **Reading language** is a user preference (`en` / `ur` / `both`, default `en`). When Urdu is chosen and a ruling has no official Urdu, the English is shown with a visible notice.
7. **Sunni banner rendering:** the banner renders after mount, because `prayer.fiqh` is loaded on the client; this avoids showing it to Ja'fari users during hydration.

### Font size impact (P4)
- One file: `noto-nastaliq-urdu-arabic-400-normal.woff2`, **159,368 bytes (~156 KiB)**. It is referenced only from a 397-byte chunk imported by the 5 `/fiqh` pages and the 2 poet pages.
- In the browser, the font was **not requested** on `/surah/1`, `/prayerTime`, `/persons` or `/persons/timeline`, and **was** registered and applied on `/fiqh`.
- **Caveat:** the PWA's existing `globPatterns` include `woff2`, so the service worker *precaches* this file for every user at install time (precache went from 241 to 242 entries). It is what makes Urdu work offline, but it is ~156 KiB extra on install for everyone. See P7.

### Shared patterns reused / created
- Reused: `$storage`, `useState` composables, `useBookmarks().toggle/remove` (new `fiqh:` namespace), `AyahReferenceCard` (wired into the topic page; no Foundations topic has a Qur'anic basis yet), the `QuranReference` type, and the Module 17 accessibility patterns (whole-card links, `aria-pressed`, labelled icon-only controls).
- Created: global `.urdu-text` / `.urdu-inline` classes, and `useUrduFont()`, which any Urdu-showing page can reuse.

### Tests
`npm test`: **26 files, 397 tests passed** (24 of them new).

### Lint
- `npx eslint .`: 119 problems (56 errors, 63 warnings). **None of the errors are in new files.**
- The two changed files that have errors (the sidebar's unused `props`, and a `U+FFFF` parse error in `bookmarks.vue`) have exactly the same errors at HEAD. They were already there and were not touched.

### Build
`npm run build`: succeeded.

### Browser verification
Playwright drove the production build (`node .output/server/index.mjs`) with Chromium at 1280, 768 and 390 px. **63 of 64 checks passed.** They covered:
- The picker appears before any ruling.
- Choosing a marja' shows the chip and 11 taqlid cards with source lines and Level A labels.
- Urdu mode shows the official Urdu with its own citation, in Noto Nastaliq Urdu, and the toggle exposes `aria-pressed`.
- English fallback with a visible notice for 2271; the women-specific panel is collapsed by default and expands correctly.
- **No fallback:** Khamenei's missing rulings show a notice, and none of Sistani's text appears. For Makarem, all 11 taqlid rulings show "being added".
- `/fiqh/glossary` and `/fiqh/choose-marja` win over `[category]`; unknown and mismatched category/topic pages show not-found.
- Search: "ihtiyat" finds "iḥtiyāṭ".
- No Sunni banner for Ja'fari users; the Settings selector shows only for Ja'fari.
- A bookmark appears in the `/bookmarks` Fiqh tab; the sidebar order is correct.
- No nested interactive elements and no unlabeled icon-only controls.
- No horizontal overflow or clipped chips on six pages at each width.
- 390 px crops were checked by eye.

**Bug found and fixed:** at 390 px the marja' chip didn't wrap Sistani's full name (72 px overflow on topic pages). It now wraps.

**The one remaining failure is external:** api.aladhan.com returned **503 with no CORS headers** for every request during testing, for both calculation methods (checked with curl). The layout's prayer-time fetch therefore logs a console error on every page. This is an outage, not a Phase 1 change. The Vercel Analytics script 404s locally on every page and was filtered out as environmental.

### Regression results
`/surah/1`, `/prayerTime`, `/persons`, `/persons/timeline` and `/poets` all returned HTTP 200, with no new console errors apart from the two environmental ones above.

### Known issues
- Explanations are English only in Phase 1. Urdu explanations are allowed (marked explanation) but none were written yet.
- The Urdu Tawzih on sistani.org may lag the English 4th edition for the ~120 rulings marked *. Each one has to be compared before its Urdu is shown (P6).

### Unsourced items left out
- All of Makarem Shirazi's rulings (P1).
- Khamenei: 7 Foundations rulings (listed per topic above) and Q 16 (P5).
- Sistani: a separate "lunar years" entry.
- Qur'anic basis cards for the Foundations topics: none added, because no cited source links specific ayahs to them.

### Open questions for the user
P5–P7 in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### Recommended next phase
Phase 2 (Taharat): water, then najasat, mutahhirat, istinja, wudu (with the procedure), ghusl, hayd/istihada/nifas and tayammum. P6 matters most there, because many taharat rulings (100–467) are on the 4th edition's revised list.


---

## Known issues outside this module (logged per decision X1, 2026-09-25 — not fixed here)
- **api.aladhan.com 503 / CORS.** During Phase 1 testing the prayer-time API returned
  503 with no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for every request, for both calculation methods.
  The layout's prayer-time fetch (`app/stores/prayer.js`) logs a console error on every page while
  this lasts. This is an external outage that affects the whole app (Module 5).
- **Pre-existing lint errors.** `npx eslint .` reports 56 errors in files this module didn't create:
  composables, server routes, older pages, and the `props` / `U+FFFF` issues in
  `LayoutNavigationDrawer.vue` and `bookmarks.vue`, which are identical at HEAD. The Wajibat files
  lint clean.

---

## Phase 1 carry-over applied at the start of Phase 2 (2026-09-25)
- **P5, Khamenei Q 16 ("it is a caution"):** checked his book for a definition of unqualified caution.
  The Glossary has no entry for "caution", and Q 48 defines only *obligatory* caution ("the obligation
  of performing or refraining from an action is a matter of caution"). So there is no definition to
  apply, and Q 16 is now shown verbatim with the neutral label "Precaution (type not specified in the
  source)". This is the new `basis: "ihtiyat_unspecified"`. The Taharat generator applies the same
  rule to every answer that opens with "As per caution", "According to caution" or similar (R3).
- **P6a:** the Urdu view now shows an app-written Urdu notice, marked as explanation, wherever the
  Urdu edition lags a revised ruling (`urduEditionLag`).
- **Sistani Ruling 434 (Bulugh):** its official Urdu (مسئلہ ۴۳۴, `/urdu/book/61/3632/`) was found, and
  the ruling is no longer English only.

### Phase 2 · Water — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added, per marja': Sistani 11 · Khamenei 4 · Makarem 0 (A: 15)
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 13–52 (selected; `/english/book/48/2118–2124/`; Urdu `/urdu/book/61/3627/`). Khamenei, Q 72, 73, 74 and 77 (`sn=5140`); Urdu س 73, 74, 75 and 78 (`sn=11374`).
- English only: 35* (rain), because the Urdu lacks the revised "utensil three times" clause; edition-lag notice shown.
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** all 10 unrevised rulings read side by side. No mismatches.
- Differences between maraji' flagged: none.

### Phase 2 · Istinjāʾ / toilet — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 13 · Khamenei 7 · Makarem 0 (A: 20)
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 53–74 (`/2125/`, `/2126/`). Khamenei, Q 90–93, 96, 97 and 98 (`sn=5141`, Q 96 in the same section); Urdu س 91–99.
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** all 13 read. One minor wording difference: 69 (istibrāʾ), where the English says "one way is as follows" and the Urdu says "the best of which is". The ruling itself (recommended) is the same.
- **Differences between maraji' flagged:** purifying the urinary outlet. Sistani (62): once suffices, twice is a recommended precaution. Khamenei (Q 97): twice, by obligatory caution. This is stored with `differsBetweenMaraji`; users see only their own marja's ruling.

### Phase 2 · Najāsāt — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 17 · Khamenei 11 · Makarem 0 (A: 28)
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 80–135 (selected; `/2128–2139/`; Urdu `/3628/`). Khamenei, Q 265, 267, 271, 273, 275, 276, 278, 282, 284, 289, 300 and 304 (`sn=5252`); Urdu س +1 (`sn=11383`).
- English only: 109* (alcohol). The revised English makes alcohol distilled from grape wine impure; the old Urdu says all alcohol is pure.
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** 80, 102 and 119 match.
- **Differences flagged:** wine and intoxicants. Sistani (108): wine is impure and other intoxicants are not. Khamenei (Q 300): intoxicating drinks are najis by obligatory caution.
- **Deliberately left out (see P8):** Rulings 103–107 on the impurity of disbelievers and certain groups. They are sourced, but their framing needs your decision.

### Phase 2 · Muṭahhirāt — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 14 · Khamenei 6 · Makarem 0 (A: 20)
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 142–227 (selected; `/2140–2153/`; Urdu `/3629/`). Khamenei, Q 267, 79, 80, 81, 85 and 291.
- English only: 178* (asphalt); the revised English adds "rubbing against a wall".
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** 143 and 185 match. **177 has a minor mismatch:** the English allows "some wetness or moisture on the earth that does not spread", and the Urdu condition (دوم) just says "the earth is dry". This ruling is unrevised, so its Urdu is currently still shown (see P10).

### Phase 2 · Wuḍūʾ — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 24 · Khamenei 11 · Makarem 0 (A: 35)
- Sources used:
  - Sistani, Rulings 235–327 and conditions 7 and 11 (`/2154/`, `/8295/` "Conditions for the validity of wuḍūʾ", `/2157–2160/`); Urdu `/3630/`.
  - Khamenei, Q 101, 102, 104, 113, 119, 121, 122, 124, 126 and 134 (`sn=5142`), plus Q 153 (`sn=5246`); Urdu س +1.
- Procedure: **Sistani wuḍūʾ, 7 steps.** Each step quotes Rulings 281, 236, 244, 248, 251 or condition 7 verbatim. The "Wājib" badges cite Ruling 235 in a step note.
- Qur'anic basis: 5:6 (R2).
- **English only:** the 7th condition* (sequence). The revised English says the left foot must be wiped after the right as an *obligatory* precaution; the old Urdu says *recommended*.
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** 247, 258 and 322 match.
- **Differences flagged:** how many times to wash. Sistani (247): once obligatory, twice recommended, three times unlawful. Khamenei (Q 101): once obligatory, twice permissible, "a third is not in the shar'". A sixth flag (wiping the feet) was removed after both texts were compared in full: both require wiping from the toe tips.

### Phase 2 · Ghusl — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 16 · Khamenei 12 · Makarem 0 (A: 28)
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 344–389 and 510 (`/2162–2168/`, `/2182/`; Urdu `/3631/`, `/3633/`). Khamenei, Q 169, 170, 176, 177, 184, 186, 187, 188, 190, 192, 196 and 198 (`sn=5247`); Urdu س +1.
- Procedures: Sistani sequential ghusl (2 steps, Ruling 360) and immersive ghusl (1 step, Ruling 366).
- Qur'anic basis: 5:6 and 4:43.
- English only: 383* (doubt about ghusl).
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** 373 and 389 match. 354 has a minor difference: the Urdu item 1 adds "in any language" and a recommendation about the names of the Prophets and Imams. It doesn't contradict the English.
- **Differences flagged:**
  - Right side before left. Sistani (360): "it is better". Khamenei (Q 190): obligatory caution.
  - Washing the hair. Sistani (378): long hair need not be washed. Khamenei (Q 192): obligatory caution to wash all of it.

### Phase 2 · Ḥayḍ, istiḥāḍah and nifās — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 16 · Khamenei 9 · Makarem 0 (A: 25). Every ruling is `sensitive`, in the collapsed panel (Q8).
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 390–502 (selected; `/2169–2181/`; Urdu `/3632/`). Khamenei, Q 216–224, excluding Q 215 (`sn=5250`); Urdu س +1.
- English only: 394* (excessive istiḥāḍah). The Urdu has "for every prayer" in its first clause, which the revised English doesn't.
- 393* (medium istiḥāḍah) was compared and matches, so the Urdu is shown.
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** 391, 438 and 448 match.
- Not used: Khamenei's Q 215. The extracted Q&A pairing looked wrong (a question about sayyid lineage with an answer about menopause), so it was left out rather than trusted.

### Phase 2 · Tayammum — 2026-09-25
- Rulings added: Sistani 13 · Khamenei 11 · Makarem 0 (A: 24)
- Sources used: Sistani, Rulings 653–712 (selected; `/2195–2205/`; Urdu `/3636/`). Khamenei, Q 199–214 (selected; `sn=5249`); Urdu س +1.
- Procedures:
  - **Sistani, 4 steps**, from Ruling 689.
  - **Khamenei, 4 steps**, from Q 208. Its step 4 (a second strike) is by obligatory caution, as the answer says. The step quotes are English only, because the Urdu answer (س 209) runs the steps together; the full Urdu Q&A is in the ruling card.
- Qur'anic basis: 5:6 and 4:43.
- English only: 712*. The revised English excepts medium istiḥāḍah; the old Urdu doesn't.
- **Urdu spot-check (R4):** 681 and 709 match. 673 has minor wording differences in the fallback order (sand, clod, pebbles), with the same substance.

## Phase 2 — Taharat — Completion Report (2026-09-25)

### What was inspected
- The official sources:
  - sistani.org English *Islamic Laws* chapter 2: 78 pages, plus the unlisted "Conditions for the validity of wuḍūʾ" page `/8295/`.
  - The Urdu *توضیح المسائل* Taharat pages (3627–3636).
  - leader.ir *Practical Laws of Islam* "Rules on Purity" (Q 69–336) and the Urdu *احکام طهارت* (س 70–337).
- The app's own Qur'an text (quranapi.pages.dev) for 5:6 and 4:43.

### What was built / changed
- **Content:** 8 Taharat topics, 131 rulings with 195 entries (Sistani 124, 117 with official Urdu; Khamenei 71, all with official Urdu), all level A. 5 step-by-step procedures. 18 new glossary terms (37 in total), quoted from the *Islamic Laws* Glossary.
- **Data model:**
  - `Procedure` / `ProcedureStep`. Each step's `instruction` must be a **verbatim substring of the cited ruling** for the same marja', and the validator enforces this.
  - `WajibatTopic.procedureIds` replaces the spec's single `procedureId`, since a topic can have several procedures and each belongs to one marja'.
  - `basis: "ihtiyat_unspecified"` (P5/R3).
  - `urduEditionLag` (P6).
- **Validator:** procedure checks (steps ordered 1..n, verbatim instructions, ruling entries for the procedure's marja', no procedures for a pending marja', topic ↔ procedure links), plus the lag check (no outdated Urdu kept on a lag entry).
- **UI:**
  - `ProcedureStepper` + `ProcedureStepBody`: one step at a time with a progress bar, Previous/Next/Start over, and "Show all steps". Each step shows the quoted text and the source line. Only the chosen marja's procedures are shown; otherwise an "a guide according to {marja} has not been added" notice appears.
  - The "Qur'anic basis" section now has an explanatory line.
  - `BasisBadge` wraps long labels, and `RulingCard` shows the Urdu edition-lag notice.

### How the texts were produced
Same method as Phase 1, with a reusable extractor: every English/Urdu ruling is indexed by its number from the downloaded pages, and every Khamenei Q&A by its Q number.
- **Khamenei's Urdu:** the purity chapter runs exactly one ahead of the English (EN Q n = UR س n+1). All 71 pairs were still checked one by one, by comparing the questions.
- **Every revised (*) Sistani ruling** was compared with its Urdu by reading both. The generator refuses to emit a revised ruling until it is marked `match` or `lag`.
- **Two Urdu-extractor bugs were found by the R4 spot-check and fixed:**
  - A cross-reference ("…مسئلہ (۶۳۳) میں…") inside a ruling was taken as the start of a new مسئلہ. This had truncated the Urdu of 84 and 389.
  - A section heading and intro leaked into the end of the previous مسئلہ (322).
  - After the fix, every generated text was diffed against the previous run. Only those three changed, and a scan found no remaining leaked headings in the Urdu, and no leaked headings or truncated endings in the English.

### Tests / Lint / Build
- `npm test`: **26 files, 406 tests passed** (33 Wajibat tests).
- `npx eslint` on the Wajibat files: clean. The 56 pre-existing errors elsewhere are unchanged (X1).
- `npm run build`: succeeded. The PWA precache is now 242 entries / 5,764.57 KiB, up from 5,469.06 KiB (+~296 KiB, mostly the ruling texts).
- **Bug found and fixed:** the `/bookmarks` Fiqh tab imported `~/data/wajibat` (the index), which put the whole rulings chunk (~335 KB) into the bookmarks page. It now imports only `topics.ts`/`categories.ts`, a 13 KB chunk.
- **Checked by recording network requests in the browser:** `/bookmarks` loads only the 13 KB chunk, `/settings` loads neither, and `/fiqh/taharat/wudu` loads the rulings chunk. Per-category lazy loading of the rulings is still spec Phase 10 work.

### Browser verification (Playwright + Chromium, production build)
- **Phase 2 suite: 37 of 37 checks passed.** It covered:
  - 8 Taharat topics, and 24 wuḍūʾ ruling cards.
  - The Qur'anic basis card (5:6).
  - The 7-step wuḍūʾ stepper: Next moves to step 2 with the quoted Ruling 236, and "Show all steps" lists all 7.
  - The Urdu edition-lag notice on the revised 7th condition, and the official Urdu with its own مسئلہ number.
  - Khamenei's view of wuḍūʾ has no Sistani procedure or text; his tayammum stepper comes from Q 208.
  - Q 16's unspecified-precaution label.
  - The women-specific rulings collapsed (20) and expanding correctly.
  - The istinjāʾ page showing only the chosen marja's differing ruling.
  - Search.
  - No overflow or clipped chips on 5 pages at 1280/768/390.
  - No nested or unlabeled controls.
  - Regression pages returning 200, and no console errors (aladhan and Vercel noise filtered, per X1).
  - 390 px crops were checked by eye.
- **The Phase 1 suite was re-run: 63 of 64 passed.** The one failure is expected: it asserted that Taharat shows the empty "scheduled for phase 2" state, and Taharat now has content.

### Architecture decisions
- **Procedures quote rulings and never paraphrase them**, and the step labels are marked as app-written. A step's hukm badge is set only where a ruling states it, and the note on the step cites that ruling.
- **Procedures are stored per marja'.** Khamenei has no numbered English wuḍūʾ procedure in his books, so his wuḍūʾ page shows the "not added" notice rather than Sistani's steps.

### Unsourced / left out
- Makarem Shirazi: everything (P1).
- Sistani 103–107 (P8).
- Khamenei: rulings with no Q&A on the same point. Each topic above shows which marja' has an entry.
- A "Is my wuḍūʾ still valid?" decision helper was **not built**. Its outcomes would mix rulings on invalidators (322), doubts (299–303) and the conditions, and a sourced tree needs your go-ahead on its scope (P11).

### Open questions
P8–P11 in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### Recommended next phase
Phase 3 (Salat core), once P8–P11 are answered. For Khamenei it should prefer *The Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* (P2).

---

## Phase 2 follow-ups from the review (2026-09-25; you committed these as 1c052ce)
- **P8, purity of persons:**
  - Sistani 103 was split into four exact excerpts, in English and Urdu.
  - 104*, 105* and 107* are English only plus the Urdu notice: their Urdu is the older text (e.g. the Urdu of 107* is a definite fatwa, the revised English an obligatory precaution).
  - 106 is shown with its Urdu.
  - Khamenei's equivalents are Q 316 (ghulāt), Q 335 (rejecting what is indispensable), Q 312 (People of the Book), Q 320 (a non-kitābī non-Muslim) and Q 298 (unknown religion).
  - His Bahāʾī-specific answers (Q 327–330) are not equivalents of any of these rulings and were left out.
  - All eight sit in a "Purity of persons" panel (`Ruling.panel`), with no app commentary.
- **P9, the 5:6 note:** quotes Ṭabāṭabāʾī, *al-Mīzān*, vol. 5, pp. 187–199: «وفهمت من الكلام وجوب غسل الوجه واليدين، ومسح الرأس والرجلين».
  - The clause was checked verbatim in two independent online copies, almerja.com and greattafsirs.com.
  - The surrounding wording differs slightly between the copies, so only the clause they share is quoted.
  - shiaonlinelibrary.com (DNS failure) and almizan.org (pages load by JavaScript) could not be used.
  - The note is stored as `quranicBasisNotes`, `kind: "explanation"`, and the validator checks it.
- **P10:** Sistani 177 is now English only, with a note.

### Phase 3 · source notes (apply to every Salat topic below)
- **Sistani:** *Islamic Laws* 4th ed., Rulings 716–1150 and 1258–1511, plus three unnumbered section introductions (the obligatory prayers, the daily prayers' rakʿahs, the eleven components). Pages `/english/book/48/2207–2276/` and the unlisted `/5418/` (times). Urdu from `/urdu/book/61/3637–3642/`.
- **Khamenei:** *The Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* (leader.ir book 241), first priority per R6.
  - It was read through the site's own contents endpoint (`POST /ajax/book`): 165 sections and 1,003 numbered rulings, each tied to its section URL `book/241?sn=…`.
  - Rulings 507, 775–778 and 786 do not appear anywhere in the published text, so they are source gaps, not omissions.
  - **The book has no official Urdu edition, so all 143 of Khamenei's Salat entries are English only (R1),** each with a note saying so.
- **R6 conflict check:** I compared the two Khamenei books on seven points: tasbīḥāt, women's loud/quiet recitation, the qaḍāʾ of the mother's prayers, "āmīn", the Friday prayer's status, the shar'ī distance (41 km in both), and sajdah on tea leaves. **No conflicts.**
  - One internal wrinkle in the *Rules* book itself: ruling 651 says the mother's qaḍāʾ is an *obligatory caution*, while a footnote to 656 says just "a caution". The entry quotes 651 verbatim.
- **Two extraction bugs found and fixed:**
  - Sistani's unnumbered traveller conditions ("Second condition: …") leaked into the end of Ruling 1266. The splitter now also handles "<Ordinal> condition:". Foundations and Taharat were regenerated and are byte-identical to what's committed.
  - leader.ir writes some letters decomposed (h + U+0323 for ḥ). All texts are now normalised to Unicode NFC, which is the same text in a single encoding, so verbatim checks compare like with like.

### Phase 3 · Salat topics — 2026-10-02
Every entry is level A. Columns are entries per marja'. "Urdu" is Sistani entries with official Urdu; Khamenei's Salat entries are all English only (see above).

| Topic | Rulings | Sistani | Urdu | Khamenei | Revised (*) Sistani rulings, Urdu outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| The obligatory prayers | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | — (two are unnumbered intros) |
| Prayer times | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | — |
| Qibla | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | — |
| Covering and clothing | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | — |
| Place of prayer | 8 | 8 | 8 | 7 | — |
| Adhān and iqāmah | 6 | 6 | 6 | 4 | — |
| Obligatory parts | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | — (one unnumbered intro) |
| Recitation | 12 | 12 | 11 | 11 | 974* lag (the Urdu lacks the nāfilah sentence) |
| Rukūʿ and sajdah | 14 | 13 | 13 | 14 | — |
| What sajdah may be on | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | — |
| Tashahhud, salām, qunūt | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | — |
| Things that invalidate | 9 | 8 | 8 | 9 | — |
| Traveller's prayer | 15 | 13 | 12 | 15 | 1266* lag (the end-of-journey sentence is new) |
| Qaḍāʾ prayers | 8 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 1370* lag (the "vow" and "deliberate omission" clauses are new) |
| Congregational prayer | 10 | 10 | 9 | 10 | 1387* lag (the Urdu says "precaution" for all cases) |
| Other obligatory prayers | 9 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 719* **match** (Friday prayer, compared in full) |
| Guided prayers | 0 (6 procedures) | 3 procedures | — | 3 procedures | — |
| **Total** | **149** | **144** | **140** | **143** | |

- **Differences between maraji' flagged (`differsBetweenMaraji`):**
  - The rukūʿ and sajdah dhikr: Sistani "any dhikr suffices, of this length"; Khamenei the specific dhikr once or "subḥānallāh" three times.
  - The eldest son and the mother's qaḍāʾ: Sistani "not obligatory, though better"; Khamenei "obligatory caution".
  - Glossary: Sistani's glossary gives a farsakh as about 5.5 km; Khamenei's ruling 410 puts eight farsakhs at 41 km. "farsakh" was therefore left out of the shared glossary, so neither marja's figure is shown to the other's followers.
- **R4 Urdu spot-check:** 30 unrevised Sistani rulings, 2 in each of the 15 subject topics (729, 742, 763, 771, 775, 825, 866, 877, 902, 921, 929, 944, 978, 980, 1008, 1042, 1062, 1068, 1100, 1103, 1140, 1145, 1258, 1320, 1355, 1360, 1433, 1441, 1470, 1496), read side by side. All match in substance.
  - One minor wording difference: in 978 the Urdu says "(احتیاط کی بناءپر)", just "precaution", where the English says "based on obligatory precaution".
- **Guided prayers:** ṣubḥ (19 steps), maghrib (27) and ẓuhr (34), for each of Sistani and Khamenei, so 160 steps in all.
  - Each step quotes its marja's own ruling, and the validator checks this.
  - Rukn steps (intention, takbīr, and each rukūʿ and pair of sajdahs) cite each marja's own rukn list: Sistani's Ruling 928, Khamenei's ruling 140.
  - "Wājib" badges cite each marja's list of eleven obligatory parts.
  - Qunūt is marked mustaḥabb.
- **Arabic in the guided prayers:**
  - Sistani's tashahhud, salām and tasbīḥāt Arabic are quoted from his rulings' own text.
  - **His rukūʿ and sajdah dhikr are published as images on sistani.org**, so those steps show the ruling's transliteration only. No Arabic was retyped (see P12).
  - Khamenei's dhikr Arabic is quoted from his ruling 318.
- **Unsourced / left out:**
  - Makarem Shirazi entirely.
  - Sistani entries the *Rules* book has no counterpart for, and vice versa (each topic shows which marja' is missing).
  - Ṣalāt al-mayyit (it belongs to the obligations towards the deceased, §6.9).
  - Prayers made obligatory by vow or hire.
  - The doubts chapter (Sistani 1151–1257, Khamenei 346–406), which is Phase 4.

## Phase 3 — Salat (core) — Completion Report (2026-10-02)

### What was built / changed
- **Content:** 17 Salat topics: 16 subject topics plus "Guided prayers" (6 procedures, 160 steps). 149 rulings with 287 entries, all level A. Glossary grows from 37 to 67 terms, each quoted from the *Islamic Laws* Glossary.
- **Data model:** `WajibatTopic.liveTool` (`"prayertimes" | "qibla"`) shows live data from Module 5 on a topic page.
- **UI:**
  - `LiveToolPanel` shows today's timings from `usePrayerStore().data` as they are. Nothing is recalculated. It notes when the user's method is Sunni and links to Prayer Times and to the Qibla tool.
  - The existing `ProcedureStepper` renders the guided prayers, with Rukn labels and hukm badges.
- **Generators:** `kh_rpf.py` (Rules book parser) and `gen_salat.py` are in the session scratchpad, not in the repo, like the earlier generators.

### Tests / Lint / Build
- `npm test`: **26 files, 411 tests passed** (38 Wajibat tests). New tests check the rakʿah/rukūʿ/sajdah/tashahhud structure of all six guided prayers, the rukn counts, that Khamenei's Salat entries all cite the Rules book and carry no Urdu, and the `liveTool` wiring.
- `npx eslint` on the Wajibat files: clean.
- `npm run build`: succeeded.

### Install-size (R5), running total of ruling text in the install-time download
| Point | PWA precache | Rulings data chunk |
|---|---|---|
| Before the module | 5,469.06 KiB | — |
| After Phase 2 | 5,764.57 KiB | ~335 KB |
| **After Phase 3** | **6,165.09 KiB** | **~730 KB** (uncompressed JS) |

- Phase 3 added **+400.5 KiB** to the install-time download. The module's running total since before it existed is **+696 KiB**, of which 156 KiB is the Urdu font.
- The rulings chunk loads only on `/fiqh` pages. Splitting it per category (spec Phase 10) would cut what each `/fiqh` page loads, but not the install-time total, since the PWA precaches every chunk.

### Browser verification (Playwright + Chromium, production build)
- **Phase 3 suite: 35 of 35 passed.** It covered:
  - 17 Salat topics.
  - The guided prayers: only the chosen marja's three; steps with ruling citations, Rukn labels and the tashahhud Arabic; Sistani's dhikr transliteration and Khamenei's Arabic from ruling 318.
  - Khamenei's English-only notes in Urdu mode.
  - The edition-lag notice on 974*, and official Urdu with مسئلہ numbers.
  - The live prayer-times panel (showing real times) and the Qibla link.
  - No cross-marja text.
  - No overflow or clipped controls on 5 pages at 1280/768/390, and no nested or unlabeled controls.
  - Regression pages (`/surah/1`, `/prayerTime`, `/persons`, wuḍūʾ, taqlīd) returning 200 with no console errors.
  - 390 px crops were checked by eye.
- **The Phase 2 suite was re-run: 37 of 37 passed.**
- AlAdhan was reachable this time, so the earlier 503 outage (X1) didn't recur.

### Open questions
P12–P14 in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### Recommended next phase
Phase 4 (salat doubts and corrections: shakkiyyāt, ṣalāt al-iḥtiyāṭ, sajdat al-sahw), plus the "Is my wuḍūʾ still valid?" helper (P11). It is high-risk: every leaf of the decision trees must cite level-A rulings, and every path will be tested.

---

## Phase 3 follow-ups from the review (2026-10-04)

- **P12, the rukūʿ/sajdah dhikr Arabic:** checked Sistani's own sources first, per the decision.
  - The official Urdu *توضیح المسائل* masla 1014 (rukūʿ) and masla 1035 (sajdah) **do** have the dhikr written as real text — this was already captured in the dataset's `ur` field (`سُبْحَانَ رَبِّیَ الْعَظِیْمِ وَبِحَمْدِہٖ` / `سُبْحَانَ رَبِّیَ الْاَعْلیٰ وَبِحَمْدِہٖ`), re-verified now against `sistani.org/urdu/book/61/3637/` live.
  - **Correction (2026-10-04):** the Arabic was first spliced directly into the English `rukudhikr`/`sajdahdhikr` ruling text. That was wrong — the English *Islamic Laws* ruling must stay a verbatim quote of the English book, which only has this dhikr as an image, and mixing in Arabic sourced from a different book (the Urdu edition) corrupts that quote. Reverted the English `text.en` back to its original `...` placeholder for the image, and instead added two new `Recitation` entries (`rukudhikrarabic`, `sajdahdhikrarabic` in the new `app/data/wajibat/recitations.ts`), cited to Urdu masla 1014/1035, linked via a new `Ruling.recitationIds` / `ProcedureStep.recitationIds` field. `RulingCard` and `ProcedureStepBody` now render the recitation in its own block, next to the ruling/step, with its own source line — never merged into the ruling's own quote. No Arabic was taken from Khamenei's pages.
  - **New validator rule:** `wajibatValidate.ts` now flags any Arabic script in a `MarjaRuling.text.en`/`question.en` that isn't marked `arabicInSource: true` — that flag may only be set when the cited **English** source book itself prints the Arabic as text (true for 10 existing entries, audited and flagged: Khamenei's dhikr-wording/tashahhud/qunūt rulings and Sistani's tasbīḥāt/tashahhud/salām/qunūt/sajdah-material/ṣalāt-al-āyāt rulings — all verified as the English book's own printed Arabic, not spliced in). This is meant to catch any repeat of this mistake automatically.
  - The Arabic *Minhāj al-Ṣāliḥīn* and the short risala *مختصر احکام عبادات* were also checked; neither exposed readable inline text for this (TOC/PDF-only), so they weren't needed once the Tawzih text was confirmed.
- **P14, ruling 651 vs. the footnote to 656:** 651 continues to be quoted verbatim, unchanged in the UI. A data note was added to the Khamenei entry on `eldestsonmother` (ruling 651) recording the footnote to 656 and why it isn't shown (the footnote is a plain "caution", not a second ruling to reconcile). The note is in the dataset only, not rendered.
- **P13, Khamenei's Urdu Q&A for Salat:** built and verified the first entry — the rukūʿ/sajdah dhikr wording, the topic already flagged as `differsBetweenMaraji`.
  - New `qa`-format ruling `rukusajdahdhikrqa` (topic `rukusujud`): Khamenei's *Practical Laws of Islam* Q&A, English Q 485 and Urdu *استفتاآت کے جوابات* س 487 (`leader.ir/ur/book/106/استفتاآت-کے-جوابات?sn=11397`), both read live and quoted verbatim. **Agrees** with Ruling 318 of *The Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* (same dhikr, same alternative), so it is shown, labelled as its own Q&A entry, not a translation of 318.
  - **Coverage so far: 1 of 16 Salat subject topics.** The other 15 (prayer times, qibla, covering, place of prayer, adhān/iqāmah, obligatory parts, recitation, what sajdah may be on, tashahhud/salām/qunūt, invalidators, traveller's prayer, qaḏā' prayers, congregational prayer, other obligatory prayers, plus any other dhikr-adjacent entries in rukūʿ/sajdah) still need the Urdu Q&A book cross-check. This is left as explicit follow-up work, not claimed done — each topic needs its own live read of the matching Urdu Q&A section before an agree/differ call can be made (rule R7).

## Install-size task (new, before Phase 4) — 2026-10-04

**Goal:** stop the ~730 KiB Wajibat ruling/procedure text from downloading at install time; cache it at runtime instead; add a "Save all for offline" button; verify in a real browser, not just the build output.

### What was built
- `nuxt.config.ts`: `vite.$client.build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` isolates everything under `app/data/wajibat/` into one chunk, named `wajibat-data-[hash].js` via a matching `chunkFileNames` override (Nuxt's own default is `[hash].js`, no `[name]`, so without this override the chunk was already isolated but had no stable name to target). `pwa.workbox.globIgnores` excludes that filename pattern from the install-time precache; a `runtimeCaching` entry (CacheFirst, cache name `wajibat-data-cache`) is kept as a backstop.
- `app/composables/useFiqhOfflineCache.ts` (new): `ensureWajibatDataCached()` and `isWajibatDataCached()`. Finds the chunk's URL from `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")` / `document.scripts`, and explicitly `fetch()`s + `cache.put()`s it into `wajibat-data-cache` if not already there.
- `useWajibat()` calls `ensureWajibatDataCached()` (fire-and-forget, client-only) every time it's used — i.e. on every `/fiqh` page — so visiting any Fiqh page keeps the whole module available offline from then on.
- `/fiqh` hub: a "Save all for offline" button (same function, on demand) with a live "Saved for offline" state, for a user who wants to be sure before going offline rather than relying on having visited.

### Bug found and fixed (real browser testing caught this; the build-output check alone did not)
The first version relied on the `runtimeCaching` rule alone, reasoning that the chunk would simply be fetched (and so cached) the first time any `/fiqh` page loaded it. **It didn't work.** Installed Playwright + a real Chromium and drove the actual production build (`node .output/server/index.mjs`):
- Confirmed, by checking `response.fromServiceWorker()` on every request on a `/fiqh` page, that every other asset (50+ JS/CSS chunks) was correctly served `fromServiceWorker: true` — so the service worker itself was genuinely active and controlling the page.
- The `wajibat-data` chunk alone showed `fromServiceWorker: false`, and `caches.open("wajibat-data-cache")` had zero entries after the visit.
- Root cause: Nuxt's SSR renderer injects `<link rel="modulepreload" href=".../wajibat-data-*.js">` into the page `<head>` for every `/fiqh` page (because the page's components statically import `~/data/wajibat`). **Chromium does not run `modulepreload` fetches through the service worker's `fetch` event.** The chunk loaded fine (modulepreload fetched it directly over the network), but that fetch was invisible to Workbox, so the `runtimeCaching` rule never fired.
- Tried removing the `<link>` two ways that didn't work and are worth recording so they aren't retried: (a) `vite.$client.build.modulePreload.resolveDependencies` — this only affects Vite's own SPA `index.html` injection, not Nuxt's SSR renderer; the link was still there after rebuilding. (b) a `hooks: { "render:html": ... }` entry in `nuxt.config.ts` — `render:html` fires on `nitroApp.hooks` (a separate, request-time hook registry inside the running server), not on the build-time `nuxt.hooks` that a top-level `hooks` key registers on, so the hook was silently never called; confirmed by a debug log that never printed even though the hook "registered" without error. A `server/plugins/*.ts` Nitro plugin would be the correct way to reach that hook, but at that point the explicit-cache approach below made chasing it further unnecessary.
- **Fix:** stopped trying to make the SW passively intercept the chunk's fetch at all. `useFiqhOfflineCache.ts` fetches and caches it explicitly from app code, which works regardless of *how* the browser originally fetched the chunk (modulepreload, dynamic import, anything).

### Browser verification (Playwright + Chromium, against `node .output/server/index.mjs`)
- **Fresh install, non-`/fiqh` page:** a brand-new browser profile, service worker confirmed `controller: true` (genuinely active and controlling), navigated to `/prayerTime` — zero requests matching the `wajibat-data` chunk, and `caches.open("wajibat-data-cache")` has no entries. Ruling text is not downloaded until `/fiqh` is opened. **Confirmed.**
- **Visiting `/fiqh` caches it:** opened `/fiqh` only (not a specific category), waited ~3 seconds — `wajibat-data-cache` has 1 entry (the chunk). Because every category/topic reads from this one chunk (the module isn't split per category — that's spec Phase 10 work, still not done), visiting the hub is enough to make every category available offline, not just the one visited.
- **Offline, client-side navigation to a never-visited topic:** went offline, then — using real link clicks inside the already-open page, not a fresh browser navigation — clicked into the Salat category and then into a specific topic (`dailyprayers`) that had never been loaded before. It rendered fully (2909 characters of real content, including the app's own "Offline" indicator in the nav drawer). **Confirmed**: once the hub has been visited (or the button used), every category works offline.
- **"Save all for offline" button:** clicked on a fresh profile that had only visited `/prayerTime` (never `/fiqh`); `wajibat-data-cache` gained the chunk, button showed "Saved for offline", and an unvisited topic then rendered offline the same way. **Confirmed.**
- **Content-hashed filename:** the chunk is `wajibat-data-<8-char-hash>.js`, where the hash is Rollup's content hash — changing any ruling's text changes the hash, so a corrected ruling ships as a new URL and a browser with the old one cached fetches the new file instead of serving stale text. Confirmed the hash changed across rebuilds that touched the Wajibat data (`CwNzGUgm` → `BoKr4D3N` after an unrelated data edit) and stayed the same across rebuilds that didn't.
- **One thing this did NOT manage to verify, and isn't claiming:** a full browser *reload* or a brand-new tab navigation (`page.goto`/F5) while offline failed in every attempt — but it failed identically for `/`, the exact page `navigateFallback` is bound to, with nothing to do with Wajibat. That strongly points to a Playwright/CDP-specific interaction between `setOffline()` and top-level navigation (sub-resource fetches were reliably interceptable throughout; only top-level `goto`/reload wasn't), not a real app bug — but it means "does a hard refresh work offline" for this SSR app in general is still an open question outside this task's scope, not something this change verified either way.

### Install-size result
| Point | PWA precache |
|---|---|
| After Phase 3 | 242 entries / 6,165.09 KiB |
| **After this task** | **240 entries / 5,431.94 KiB** |

The Wajibat ruling/procedure text (~730 KiB) is no longer in the install-time download. The 2-entry drop (242→240) is the `wajibat-data` chunk itself plus the duplicate-named chunk entry Rollup had been emitting for it; nothing else changed.

### Tests / Lint
`npm test`: 26 files, 412 tests passed (unchanged — this task touched no Wajibat content, only build config and a new, pure-utility composable). `npx eslint` on the changed files: clean.

### Files created / changed
- Created: `app/composables/useFiqhOfflineCache.ts`.
- Changed: `nuxt.config.ts` (manualChunks, chunkFileNames, workbox globIgnores/runtimeCaching), `app/composables/useWajibat.ts`, `app/pages/fiqh/index.vue` (button simplified to use the new composable).

## P13 completion — in progress, 2026-10-04

> **Correction (2026-10-07):** two claims in this section were wrong, and its entries were not verbatim.
> (1) The Q&A book **does** cover qaḍāʾ, parents' qaḍāʾ, congregational, Friday, ʿĪd, traveller's and āyāt prayers, in both English
> (sn=5271–5289) and Urdu (sn=11402–11421). (2) The Urdu texts for س 365/368 were available. (3) `qiblaeffortqa`, `qiblanomeansqa`
> and `rukusajdahdhikrqa` were paraphrases labelled level A. All three are replaced with verbatim quotes. See the 2026-10-07 section below.

**Chapter map found** (Khamenei's *Practical Laws of Islam* Q&A, English chapter sn=5197 / Urdu chapter sn=11341): the English edition's Prayer chapter is Q337–Q506+, in 13 named sections; the Urdu edition has the same 13 plus 4 more (جواب سلام, شکیات نماز, قضا نماز, ماں باپ کی قضا نمازیں) that don't exist as named English sections. Checked directly (fetched sn=5269 and sn=5290, which list the chapter's own Q-range): confirmed the **English book has no Q&A coverage at all for qaḏāʾ prayers, traveller's prayer, or congregational prayer** — not a truncated fetch, the chapter's Q-range genuinely has nothing there. Per decision P13/R7 (supplementary entries need the book's own English citation, same as every other ruling), these three topics plus "Other obligatory prayers" get **no supplementary entries**: 0 available, not 0 found-but-skipped.

**Topics done this session (2 of 16, including the rukūʿ/sajdah dhikr entry from the Phase 3 follow-up above):**
- Rukūʿ and sajdah (dhikr wording only — see above).
- **Qibla**: two new entries. `qiblaeffortqa` (Q 363, agrees with Ruling 44 — compass/sun for certainty, else the most likely direction). `qiblanomeansqa` (Q 366, agrees with Ruling 45 — four directions, obligatory caution, when none is more likely). Both **English only**: the Urdu equivalents (س 365, س 368) exist but this session's fetch of that page returned an English paraphrase of them, not quotable Urdu script — rather than guess at the Urdu wording, only the English Q&A is shown, same as any ruling with no official Urdu available (decision R1). `urduNote` on each entry records this so a later session can go back and read the Urdu properly instead of re-deciding whether to.

**Honest pace note:** this cross-check is slow by nature — each topic needs its own live read of the matching English and Urdu Q&A sections, not just a lookup, to avoid guessing at either language's wording. Two topics took a full research pass each. At this rate the other 13 are a multi-session effort, not something to compress into one sitting without risking exactly the kind of shortcut (inventing Urdu wording, assuming a match without reading both sides) that decision P13 exists to prevent. Remaining, in the order their Q&A coverage is already confirmed to exist: the obligatory prayers (Q337–343), prayer times (Q344–362), place of prayer (Q368–425), covering and clothing (Q426–447), adhān/iqāmah (Q448–455), recitation (Q456–476), what sajdah may be on (within Q478–497), tashahhud/salām/qunūt (within Q478–497, plus جواب سلام in Urdu only), things that invalidate (Q498–506+). Confirmed with no Q&A coverage, nothing further to do: qaḏāʾ prayers, traveller's prayer, congregational prayer, other obligatory prayers.

## Pre-commit fixes and P13 completion — 2026-10-07

### 1. Source-snapshot validator (your item 1)
- **What it is:** `validateSourceSnapshot()` in `app/utils/wajibatValidate.ts`, plus `tests/fixtures/wajibatSourceSnapshot.json` (test-only, ~590 KB, never shipped).
  - For every quoted text the fixture holds the official unit it came from: 1,227 numbered rulings / Q&As, 8 marked excerpts, 37 unnumbered passages (section intros, "conditions") and 2 recitations.
  - The units are built by script (`snapshot.py`) from the downloaded official pages, never from the dataset.
- **The rule:** a quote must equal its numbered unit. It may be a verbatim part of it only when it's marked `excerpt`, or when the source is an unnumbered passage. A quote with no unit fails.
- **What it caught straight away:** the three Q&A entries hand-added on 2026-10-04 (`qiblaeffortqa`, `qiblanomeansqa`, `rukusajdahdhikrqa`) were **paraphrases labelled level A**. For example, Q 485's answer was rewritten, and its Urdu cut short. All three are now verbatim (section 3).
- **New tests:**
  - the check passes on the dataset, with exactly one unit per quote;
  - it flags a paraphrased answer;
  - it flags Arabic spliced into Sistani's rukūʿ ruling (both by the snapshot and by the existing `arabicInSource` rule);
  - it flags a quote with no unit.
- **Also fixed (P12):** the hand edit had put `recitationIds` on the per-marja' entry, but `RulingCard` reads it from the ruling. So the sourced Arabic dhikr showed in the guided-prayer steps but **never on the ruling cards**. It's now on the ruling, and the browser check confirms the card shows سُبْحَانَ رَبِّیَ الْعَظِیْمِ وَبِحَمْدِہٖ cited to مسئلہ (1014).
- **Reproducibility:** every 2026-10-04 hand edit to the generated `salat.ts` / `procedures/salat.ts` is now applied by the generator: `arabicInSource`, the P12 notes and recitation links, and the P14 data note. Regenerating reproduces the committed files exactly, apart from the two fixes above.

### 2. Install-size and offline (your item 2), Playwright + Chromium against `node .output/server/index.mjs`
`verify4.cjs`: **22/22 checks passed.**
- **Fresh install:**
  - the service worker is active and controlling the page;
  - the ruling chunk is requested **0** times on `/prayerTime`;
  - of the 240 cached precache entries, **0** are ruling text.
- **Visited category works offline:**
  - opening `/fiqh/salat` caches exactly this build's chunk;
  - offline, a Salat topic renders, and so do never-visited Taharat and Foundations topics (one chunk holds the whole module).
- **"Save all for offline":** on a profile with the cache cleared, the button caches the chunk and shows "Saved for offline". Offline, Foundations, Taharat, the traveller's prayer and the guided prayers all render.
- **Content-hashed filename, and stale copies:** the chunk is `/_nuxt/wajibat-data-<8-char content hash>.js`.
  - The hash changed with every data change today: `CShtccx7` → `Ca4vWSkt` after adding one Q&A entry. Earlier it was `BoKr4D3N`.
  - **Gap found and fixed:** the old copy was never deleted, and "Saved for offline" was true if *any* copy was cached, even a stale one. `ensureWajibatDataCached()` now deletes copies from earlier builds once this build's chunk is cached, and `isWajibatDataCached()` checks this build's URL.
  - Verified by planting a fake `wajibat-data-OLDBUILD.js`: after the next `/fiqh` visit only the current chunk remains.
- **Not verified (unchanged from 2026-10-04):** a hard reload / new-tab navigation while offline. Offline tests use in-app navigation, because Playwright's `setOffline` blocks top-level navigations for every page of this app, not just Fiqh.
- **Regressions:** Salat `verify3.cjs` 35/35, Taharat `verify2.cjs` 37/37.

### Install-size (R5) — running total
| Point | PWA install-time precache | Ruling chunk (runtime-cached, not at install) |
|---|---|---|
| Before the module | 5,469.06 KiB | — |
| After Phase 3, before R8 | 6,165.09 KiB | in precache |
| After R8 (2026-10-04) | 240 entries / 5,431.94 KiB | ~730 KB |
| **Now** | **240 entries / 5,432.20 KiB** | **859 KB (181 KB gzip)**, `wajibat-data-Ca4vWSkt.js` |

The install-time download is **37 KiB smaller than before the module started**: the 156 KiB Urdu font is still in it, but no ruling text. The +0.26 KiB since R8 is code (the visibility filter and cache pruning). The chunk grew ~129 KB with the 53 Q&A entries; it downloads only when Fiqh is opened.

### 3. P13 — Khamenei's Q&A book for the Salat topics
- **Method:**
  - Read every Q&A in the Prayer chapter's sections that map to the 16 Salat subject topics: 359 Q&As in 34 sections, plus the 3 "Miscellaneous" Q&As that touch them.
  - Picked those that answer the **same point** as a *Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* ruling, and compared the two. Then matched each to its Urdu counterpart **by content**: the Urdu numbering runs 1–4 ahead and drifts within sections.
  - Checked the Urdu agrees too.
  - Every question and answer (EN + UR) is verified word for word against the live leader.ir section page (`verify_kqa.py`: 53/53 entries, 0 mismatches).
- **Display:** each entry is a `supplementary` ruling, shown only to Khamenei's followers, with `agreesWith` citing the *Rules* rulings it was compared with. Sistani's followers don't see it at all: no "not added yet" card, not in search, not counted in coverage.

| Topic | Q&As read | Same point as a *Rules* ruling | Agree (shown) | Differ (not shown) | With official Urdu | Pairs (Q → *Rules* n.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Daily prayers | 7 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Q 337→2 |
| Prayer times | 19 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | Q 348→24, Q 350→4, Q 358→18, Q 360→27, Q 361→8/13 |
| Qibla | 5 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 | Q 363→44, Q 364→45, Q 366→45 |
| Covering and clothing | 21 | 6 | 6 | 0 | 6 | Q 428→59, Q 435→51, Q 440→90, Q 443→90, Q 429→84, Q 439→85 |
| Place of prayer | 57 (+3 misc.) | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | Q 382→100, Q 372→112, Q 386→107, Q 723→107, Q 384→114 |
| Adhān and iqāmah | 8 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Q 454→131 |
| Obligatory parts | (in other sections) | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Q 455→162/163 |
| Recitation | 21 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | Q 456→190/197, Q 469→191, Q 473→172, Q 465→200, Q 481→184 |
| Rukūʿ and sajdah | 9 | 3 | 2 | **1** | 2 | Q 485→221/243, Q 489→260; **Q 342→223 differs** |
| What sajdah may be on | 11 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 | Q 487→267, Q 493→265, Q 498→281 |
| Tashahhud, salām, qunūt | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | the Q&A section is about returning greetings; Q 510 matches the *Rules* ruling in "invalidators" |
| Things that invalidate | 9 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 | Q 503→334, Q 501→343, Q 510→332 |
| Traveller's prayer | 67 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | Q 637→407, Q 638→408, Q 674→506, Q 671→588/558, Q 641→478 |
| Qaḍāʾ prayers | 26 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 | Q 531→638/639, Q 536→639, Q 540→651 |
| Congregational prayer | 55 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 4 | Q 563→730, Q 594→712, Q 574→717, Q 577→728, Q 607→763 |
| Other obligatory prayers | 38 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | Q 605→762, Q 622→764, Q 629→784, Q 631→681, Q 707→660 |
| **Total** | **359 (+3)** | **54** | **53** | **1** | **52** | |

- **The one that differs:** Q 342 (س 343) says stillness is required for recommended dhikrs as a flat ruling. *Rules* 223 says it **by obligatory caution**, and only when the dhikr is intended as part of the rukūʿ. Not shown.
- **English only:** Q 594 (a woman leading women in congregation). The Urdu section has no counterpart in that position (its س 596 is a sajdah question), so it gets the R1 `urduNote`.
- **Urdu less specific, still shown:** Q 364/366 and Q 455. The Urdu says "بنابر احتیاط" / "احتیاط یہ ہے" where the English answer and the *Rules* say "obligatory caution". It's the same kind of difference as Sistani 978 (R4), and each entry's note says so.
- **Footnotes:** Q 428's `<sup>1</sup>` marker and the section footnote that the parser had attached to Q 439's answer ("1. Except for cases mentioned in fiqhī books…") are dropped. That's the same rule as every other quote (footnote markers are never part of the text). The live-page check strips `<sup>` and confirms the rest is verbatim.
- **Not compared yet:**
  - "Doubt in Prayers" (8 Q&As) goes with Phase 4.
  - "Prayer Performed by Hiring" (2) and "Nāfilahs" (6) have no matching *Rules* ruling in the current topics.
  - Of "Miscellaneous" (7), only Q 723 matched.
- **New question found while reading:** *Rules* 465 contradicts *Rules* 452 (leisure travel "not shortened"). See P15. Nothing changed yet.

## Phase 4 — scope (awaiting your review; nothing built)

**Goal (spec §12 Phase 4 + P11):** salat doubts and corrections, plus the "Is my wuḍūʾ still valid?" helper. Every leaf of every helper must cite level-A rulings of the chosen marja'. A branch that can't be sourced isn't shipped; it shows "Please refer to your marja's risala, Issue n" instead.

**1. Content: three new Salat topics**
| Topic | Sistani (*Islamic Laws* + Urdu *Tawzih*) | Khamenei (*Rules* 2023 first, R6; Q&A per R7) |
|---|---|---|
| Doubts in prayer (shakkiyyāt): doubt about the prayer itself, a part, the number of rakʿahs; invalidating vs valid doubts; doubts to ignore (after passing the place, after salām, after the time, kathīr al-shakk, imam/follower, recommended prayers) | The doubts chapter (around Rulings 1144–1255). **Not downloaded yet**: my copy has only 94 of Rulings 1100–1300. First step: download it (EN + UR), then the R4 spot-check and a revised-(*) comparison | *Rules* 346–387 (42 rulings, already downloaded) + Q&A "Doubt in Prayers" Q 514–521 / س 516–523 |
| Ṣalāt al-iḥtiyāṭ | Same chapter | *Rules* 370–372 |
| Sajdat al-sahw, and making up a forgotten sajdah/tashahhud | Same chapter | *Rules* 388–406 |

**2. "I have a doubt in my prayer" helper, one tree per marja'** (spec §7.1 `DecisionTree` / `DecisionNode`)
- Asks, one step at a time:
  - when (during the prayer / after salām / after the time);
  - what about (whether I prayed / a part / the number of rakʿahs);
  - which prayer (2/3/4-rakʿah, āyāt);
  - for rakʿah doubts: which numbers, and at which point (e.g. after completing the second sajdah).
- Each leaf shows that marja's ruling(s) **quoted verbatim**, with the remedy and its source.
- **Validator:** every node reachable; no cycles; every option points to an existing node; every leaf cites ≥ 1 level-A ruling of the tree's marja' (or is a "refer to risala, Issue n" leaf); no leaf cites another marja's ruling.
- **Tests walk every path** (spec), checking each one ends at a sourced leaf.
- The trees will differ between the maraji'. For example, which rakʿah doubts are valid, and the exact point at which a doubt counts as "after the second sajdah", come from each marja's own list.

**3. "Is my wuḍūʾ still valid?" helper (P11)**
- **Sistani:** "Things that invalidate wuḍūʾ" (downloaded) + his doubt-about-wuḍūʾ rulings (already in the dataset from Phase 2).
- **Khamenei:** neither English book has an invalidator list. His *Practical Laws* purity chapter only answers individual cases, e.g. Q 101, Q 130, Q 140, plus glossary notes on madhī/wadhī/wadī. See **P16** for the options; my recommendation is (a), sourced branches only.

**4. UI**
- A `DecisionHelper` component on the topic page:
  - one question at a time, with Back and Start over;
  - an accessible radio group with a live region for the result;
  - Urdu supported, phone width supported.
- The leaf shows the quoted ruling card(s) and a "your marja's risala, Issue n" link.
- Question wording is app-written (`kind: "explanation"`), see **P17**.

**5. Checks (same as earlier phases):**
- the R4 spot-check per topic, plus the revised-(*) comparison for Sistani;
- the R6 conflict check between Khamenei's two books;
- the source snapshot extended to the new rulings;
- R5 size reporting;
- Playwright at 1280/768/390.

**Decisions I need before building:** P15 (*Rules* 465), P16 (Khamenei's wuḍūʾ helper), P17 (helper wording in Urdu).

**Size estimate:** the largest content phase so far. Around 110 Sistani rulings + ~60 Khamenei rulings, plus 4 trees (2 doubt trees, 2 wuḍūʾ trees) and their path tests. The trees, not the extraction, are where most of the time goes.

## Review round 2026-10-07 (P15–P17, R9, R10) and Phase 4a — report

### P15 — Khamenei *Rules* 465: hidden, mistranslation confirmed
- **(a) The surrounding rulings:**
  - 465 sits under "Continuation of the Travel's Permissibility", not under a particular kind of trip. Hunting for amusement is a separate subsection (469–471: lahwī hunting → full prayer).
  - Its neighbour 462 names "tourism" as a *permissible* purpose, and permissible travel is shortened (452).
  - So 465 cannot be read as being about a specific trip. As printed in English, it contradicts 452 and 462.
- **(b) The Persian original:** رساله نماز و روزه (leader.ir book 180, crawled through the site's contents endpoint), مسأله 466, same heading: «سفر برای تفریح و تفرّج حرام نیست و نماز در آن قصر است». The prayer **is shortened**.
  - The official **Urdu** edition (book 197, see P18) agrees: مسئلہ 466 «تفریح کے لئے سفر کرنا حرام نہیں ہے اور اس میں نماز قصر ہوگی».
  - The English edition is numbered one lower here (465 = 466).
- **Result:** the English 465 is a translation error.
  - It is withheld in the generator: `entries.py` `HIDDEN_RPF`, with the reason recorded, so a regeneration can't bring it back.
  - On "Travelling for recreation", Khamenei's followers see "not added yet — refer to his risala"; Sistani's ruling is unchanged.
  - No translation of ours is shown anywhere. A test asserts no entry cites *Rules* 465.

### P16 — Khamenei's practical treatise
- **Official translations:** leader.ir has **an official Urdu translation** of *Risāla-yi Āmūzishī*: «احکام آموزشی» (book 201, 77 lessons; Persian original book 137). There is **no English translation**: the English library (books 24–256) has none, and english.khamenei.ir refuses connections from this environment.
- **What it covers:** lesson 16 (وضو (4), leader.ir sn=32120) gives **his full list of the seven things that invalidate wuḍūʾ**, plus his rules on doubting whether one did wuḍūʾ, whether it broke, and whether it was valid.
  - So Khamenei's wuḍūʾ helper can be **fully sourced in Urdu** in Phase 4b. That's more than the Q&A-only fallback.
  - How to show it to English-mode users is **P19**.

### R9 — generators in the repo (`scripts/wajibat/`)
- **What's committed:** every generator plus the shared builders, `build.py` (regenerates everything), `fetch_sources.py`, `sources.manifest.json` (231 source files: URL, fetch date, SHA-256), the HTML-to-text converter, the leader.ir book crawler, the live Q&A check and a README.
  - The source-unit records the verbatim test reads are in `tests/fixtures/wajibatSourceSnapshot.json` (also committed).
  - Raw pages stay out of git: `scripts/wajibat/.cache/` is git-ignored.
- **Reproducibility, verified:**
  1. `build.py` from the repo regenerates every committed data file **identically**: no content diff before the P15/4a changes.
  2. The recovered `h2t.py` plus a fresh download of sistani.org page 2247 reproduces the cached text **byte for byte**.
  3. Deleting two cached pages and running `fetch_sources.py` re-downloaded both with **unchanged hashes**.
- **Changes made while moving the scripts:**
  - The shared entry builders moved from `gen_salat.py` into `entries.py`, so `gen_doubts.py` uses the same code.
  - Q&A placement into `topics.ts` is now a script (`place_qa_ids.py`), not a one-off.
  - `CLAUDE.md` now says the data is generated and must not be hand-edited.

### A correction found on the way (raised as P18)
- **The note was false:** every Khamenei *Rules* entry carried `urduNote`: "has no official Urdu edition on leader.ir".
- **The real situation:** leader.ir *does* publish one, «نماز اور روزه کی احکام» (book 197), a full translation of the Persian original. It has the same 166 sections, and its numbering (1–1011) follows the Persian, not the English (1–1003).
- **What changed:** the note now says the Urdu edition "has not yet been matched to this ruling, so only the English is shown for now". Matching it is a large change across Phases 3 and 4a, so it's a question for you, not something done here.

### Phase 4a — content
- **Sistani:** downloaded the doubts chapter of *Islamic Laws*: pages 2250–2263, plus page 8298 (Rulings 1154–1164, "doubt after passing the place", which is linked outside the main page range). Rulings 1120–1260 are now complete in English, and Urdu (page 3638) was already complete.
- **Khamenei:** *Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023*, 346–406.

| Topic | Rulings | Paired (both maraji') | Sistani entries (with Urdu) | Khamenei entries | Points to the other card (`seeAlso`) | Differs between maraji' | Khamenei Q&A (P13/R7) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Doubts in prayer | 54 | 30 | 49 (48) | 35 | 5 | 5 | 4 (Q 514–517) |
| Ṣalāt al-iḥtiyāṭ | 22 | 3 | 22 (22) | 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 (Q 520) |
| Sajdat al-sahw and forgotten parts | 40 | 15 | 36 (36) | 19 | 2 | 3 | 3 (Q 518, 519, 521) |
| **Total** | **116** | **48** | **107 (106)** | **57** | **7** | **9** | **8** |

- **Coverage:**
  - **Sistani:** every ruling of the chapter, 1151–1257, each exactly once (a test asserts it).
  - **Khamenei:** every ruling 346–406 except four restatements inside his own book: 361 (only names the two kinds of rakʿah doubt), 365 (repeats 364's method), 374 (repeats 348), 377 (repeats part of 347). These are listed in the generator header.
- **New: `seeAlso`.** Where one book states a point inside another ruling on the same page, the other marja's followers see "His ruling on this point is part of “…”", with a link to that card. That replaces a misleading "not added yet". The validator checks:
  - the marja' really has no entry in this card;
  - the target is in the same topic;
  - the target has his entry.

  Coverage doesn't count these points as gaps.
- **Differences flagged (`differsBetweenMaraji`):**
  - **Invalidating rakʿah doubts:** Sistani lists 8 cases, adding 2/5, 3/6 and 4/6; Khamenei lists 5.
  - **Valid doubts:** Sistani lists 9. Khamenei lists 6, noting other rare cases are in the detailed books.
  - **Restarting instead of ṣalāt al-iḥtiyāṭ:** Sistani makes iḥtiyāṭ a recommended precaution and voids the second prayer by obligatory precaution. Khamenei calls the restart a sin and the second prayer void.
  - **Missing a rukn in a nāfilah:** Sistani rules it invalidates; Khamenei says so by obligatory caution.
  - **Bismillāh in ṣalāt al-iḥtiyāṭ:** Sistani whispers it as a recommended precaution; Khamenei includes it by obligatory caution.
  - **When sajdat al-sahw is due:** for a forgotten sajdah it is recommended for Sistani but an obligatory caution for Khamenei, and talking is the reverse.
  - **Talking by mistake** and **sighing / "oh":** Sistani requires sajdat al-sahw by obligatory precaution; Khamenei states it as a ruling.
  - **A sajdah doubt while getting up:** Sistani 1158 says dismiss it («کھڑا ہوتے وقت», confirmed in his Urdu); Khamenei 353 says perform the sajdah. Khamenei's tashahhud entry on that card has a note pointing to 353.
- **Revised (*) Sistani rulings (P6):**
  - 1220* **lags** (the English adds "based on obligatory precaution, this also applies to nāfilah prayers"; the Urdu lacks it), so English only plus the lag notice.
  - 1222* **matches**, so its Urdu is shown.
- **R4 spot-check:** 2 unrevised rulings per topic (1154, 1179, 1201, 1213, 1231, 1242). All match. In 1213 the Urdu «احتیاط لازم» is Sistani's own term for obligatory precaution.
- **Source typo:** Sistani 1154 is printed "Sūrat al-Ḥamd00" on sistani.org (page 8298 HTML). It is quoted as published, with a data note; it is not corrected.
- **P13/R7 for these topics:** the Q&A section "Doubt in Prayers" (Q 514–521 / س 516–523) was compared with the *Rules*.
  - **All 8 agree, and all are shown with official Urdu.**
  - Q 519 says only "based on caution" (in Urdu too) where the *Rules* 397/402 say obligatory caution. It's less specific, not different, and noted.
  - Live-page check: 61/61 Q&A entries, 0 mismatches.
- **R6:** that Q&A comparison is also the conflict check between his two books for these topics. No conflicts.
- **Glossary:** six terms cut verbatim from Sistani's glossary: shakk, shakkiyyāt, ẓann, kathīr al-shakk, ṣalāt al-iḥtiyāṭ, sajdatā al-sahw.

### Tests / lint / build / browser
- `npm test`: 26 files, **422 tests passed**.
  - New tests: complete chapter coverage for both maraji', the P15 exclusion, the revised-ruling handling, `seeAlso` integrity, and the validator catching a bad `seeAlso`.
- `npx eslint` on the module: clean. `npm run build`: OK.
- Playwright against the production build:
  - **Phase 4a, `verify5.cjs`: 34/34.** Covers:
    - Sistani and Khamenei content verbatim, and Urdu with masla numbers;
    - the 1220* lag notice and the `seeAlso` link;
    - the Ḥamd00 note;
    - Khamenei's Q&A only for him, with its Urdu;
    - P15 (465 absent);
    - no overflow at 1280/768/390 in both languages;
    - a11y and no console errors.
  - Regressions: Salat 35/35 (two assertions updated for 20 topics and the corrected note), Taharat 37/37, offline/install 22/22.

### Install-size (R5) — running total
| Point | Install-time precache | Ruling chunk (runtime, only when Fiqh is opened) |
|---|---|---|
| Before the module | 5,469.06 KiB | — |
| After R8 (2026-10-04) | 5,431.94 KiB | ~730 KB |
| After P13 (2026-10-07, morning) | 5,432.20 KiB | 859 KB |
| **Now (Phase 4a)** | **240 entries / 5,432.58 KiB** | **1,092 KB (219 KB gzip)** |

Still no ruling text at install time. The chunk grew 233 KB with the 116 rulings and 8 Q&As.

### Open questions
- **P18:** match Khamenei's official Urdu *Rules* edition to his entries?
- **P19:** how to show the Urdu-only wuḍūʾ helper to English-mode users.

Both are in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### Recommended next step
Phase 4b, the helpers, after your review of 4a and your answers to P18/P19. P19 only matters for 4b; P18 can be done separately.

## P18 — Khamenei's official Urdu *Rules*, checked against the Persian original (2026-10-07)

### What was matched
- **Three official editions of the same book**, all on leader.ir and all read through the site's own contents endpoint:
  - the **Persian original**, رساله نماز و روزه (book 180): 1,010 rulings;
  - the **official Urdu edition**, نماز اور روزه کی احکام (book 197): 1,010 rulings, the same numbering as the Persian;
  - the **English** *Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* (book 241), which we already quote: 1,003 rulings.
- Ruling 788 is missing from the Persian and the Urdu editions alike, so it is a gap in the source and not in the parsing.
- **Pairing, never by number alone.** All three editions list the same sections in the same order. The English edition lacks some Persian rulings in the prayer chapter and merges one pair, so its numbers drift (+1 after 52, +2 after 495):
  - English **506 = Persian/Urdu 508 + 509** (merged);
  - Persian 52, 495 and 777–780 have no English counterpart.

  Every pair was then **read side by side in all three languages**: 200 entries (the 199 from before plus ruling 465). A typo in the Urdu source's numbering ("5929") and another in the Persian ("8003") were read as the next number in sequence and are logged.
- **Citations.** Each entry now cites the Urdu ruling under its own number, e.g. «نماز اور روزه کی احکام — مسئلہ 466». It also records the Persian ruling it was compared with. That is metadata and a small caption: *"Compared with the Persian original: مسأله 466"*. The Persian text is never displayed.

### Result (rule R11: the Persian decides)
| Verdict | Entries | What the user sees |
|---|---|---|
| **English, Urdu and Persian agree** | **188** | English; the official Urdu too in Urdu mode |
| **English differs from the Persian (Urdu matches)** | **7** | English **hidden**; the official Urdu is shown in **every** language mode, with a notice that the English edition differs from the Persian and that the app does not translate |
| **Urdu differs from the Persian (English matches)** | **3** | the English; in Urdu mode, the English with a notice (no Urdu shown) |
| **Only a footnote differs** | **2** | the English ruling text only (a verbatim excerpt), with a note; the Urdu carries its footnote |

**English hidden (7).** The reasons are in `scripts/wajibat/rules_verdicts.py`:
| English ruling | Where | Why the English differs from the Persian |
|---|---|---|
| **465** (P15) | leisure travel | says the prayer is **not** shortened; the Persian (مسأله 466) and the Urdu (مسئلہ 466) say it **is** shortened |
| 89 | clothes woven with gold | says "woven with gold"; the Persian and Urdu add "or in which gold is used" |
| 190 | loud/quiet recitation | the English drops "first two rakʿahs" and says only men for ẓuhr/ʿaṣr; the Persian and Urdu say **men and women** |
| 221 | dhikr of rukūʿ | the English allows any other dhikr; the Persian and Urdu exclude the dhikr specific to sajdah |
| 364 | the valid doubts (item 1) | the English says "three or four rakʿahs … consider it the 3rd rakʿah, perform another rakʿah"; the Persian and Urdu say **two or three**, which is what the rest of the item requires. The English is internally inconsistent. (Found in Phase 4b, while building the doubts helper.) |
| 394 | a part of the salām said by mistake | the English says flatly "should perform sajdatā al-sahw"; the Persian and Urdu say **by obligatory caution** |
| 711 | imam's conditions | the English says "obligatory caution" for bāligh; the Persian and Urdu say only "caution", with the type **unspecified**, so the P5 note applies |

**Urdu hidden (3).**
- **265:** the Urdu gives "gold, silver and glass" as its examples where the Persian says metals and glass.
- **390:** the Urdu merges two conditions (unwillingly, or thinking the prayer is over) into one.
- **588:** the Urdu says the full prayer is due "after the 31st day" (اکتیسویں دن کے بعد); the Persian and the English say after the 30th day. (Found in Phase 4b by a numeric comparison.)

**Footnote only (2).**
- **Ruling 4** (fajr): the English footnote leaves out the practical guidance of about ten minutes after the adhān that the Persian and Urdu give.
- **Ruling 44** (qibla): the English footnote says "May 7", while the Persian (هفتم خرداد) and Urdu say 28 May. Khamenei's own Q&A also says 28 May.

**Borderline cases treated as agreeing. Please say if you would rather withhold them:**
- **138 (list of the eleven obligatory acts):** the English lists takbīrah before standing; the Persian and Urdu list standing before takbīrah. The content is the same.
- **141 (intention):** the English drops the parenthetical "which is one of the rukn acts"; ruling 140 in the same English book lists intention among the rukns. This one is used by the guided prayers, so withholding it would also change the prayer steps.

**Also noted.**
- Three footnotes exist only in the English (rulings 15, 382, 604: translator's notes and definitions) and three only in the Urdu (rulings 1, 322, 764). None changes a ruling.
- The footnote of ruling 346 is fuller in the Urdu than in the English, with no contradiction.
- A guard was added: a guided-prayer step may not quote a ruling whose English is withheld, and none does today.

### How reliable is this?
- The checks were **read by me, side by side, not computed**.
- I first tried automatic signals (obligatory-caution counts, numbers, negations). They were too noisy to trust on their own.
- Reading missed one entry on the first pass (394: an omitted "by obligatory caution"); it showed up when a signal flagged it. **Two more were missed in two full reading passes and only found later by a numeric ordered-sequence comparison: English 364 ("three or four") and Urdu 588 ("31st day").** Both are now logged above. So **qualifier-level differences are the place I could have missed something.** I recommend a second reader on the 188 "agree" entries before release. The Phase 10 audit already plans one.
- The Persian footnotes were compared only where the English and Urdu footnotes differ.
- Sistani is **not** affected: his English 4th edition is newer than his Urdu, so the English wins there (P6, unchanged).

### Tests and checks
- **Dataset tests:** 425 pass.
  - New: every Khamenei Rules entry cites its Urdu and Persian rulings (200 entries, 197 with Urdu).
  - New: exactly the seven English-withheld and three Urdu-withheld entries (updated in Phase 4b from six and two).
  - New: 465 shows the Urdu مسئلہ 466 and not the English.
  - New: the footnote trims.
  - New: the validator catches a withheld English without its Urdu or Persian check, and a guided-prayer step that quotes withheld English.
- **Source snapshot:** all 1,721 numbered quotes (English, Urdu and Q&A) match their official units exactly.
- **Browser, Playwright against the production build:** `verify6.cjs` 30/30. It covers:
  - 465 in English and Urdu mode, and Sistani unchanged;
  - each English-withheld and Urdu-withheld case;
  - the footnote trims and the merged 508 + 509;
  - the Persian caption;
  - no overflow at 768 and 390 in both languages.

  Regressions: Phase 4a 34/34, Salat 35/35 (its Urdu-note assertion updated), Taharat 37/37, offline/install 22/22.
- **Install-size (R5):** the install-time download is **5,433.61 KiB** (it was 5,432.58). The ruling chunk is 1,191 KB (240 KB gzip), up 99 KB with the ~198 Urdu Rules texts, and still downloads only when Fiqh is opened.

## Phase 4b — the decision helpers (2026-10-07)

Four helpers, each for **one** marja' and shown only to his followers: prayer doubts and wuḍūʾ, for Sistani and for Khamenei.
They sit on the *Doubts in prayer* and *Wuḍūʾ* topic pages under "Find your answer". Makarem has none (no sources yet, P1).

### What they do
- One question per screen. Every question has an **"I'm not sure"** option (R12) that goes to a pointer to the marja's own book (book, issue range, official link, his office), never to a guessed answer. There is a visible **Back** and **Start over**, and an answer trail.
- Every result shows the marja's name and the **"Not scholar-reviewed"** label, the marja's own words as a verbatim quote with its citation and an official link, the phrase that states the answer highlighted, and a link to open the full ruling on the same page.
- Questions only describe the user's situation (P17a). Each option stores the ruling and the exact phrase of the marja's text it rests on (P17b).
- Nothing is a ruling written by the app, and nothing is translated. Question screens are English only.

| Helper | Questions | Ruling answers | Pointer answers | Root-to-answer paths |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sistani, prayer doubts | 23 | 43 | 2 | 138 |
| Khamenei, prayer doubts | 20 | 40 | 2 | 81 |
| Sistani, wuḍūʾ | 7 | 19 | 1 | 26 |
| Khamenei, wuḍūʾ | 4 | 13 | 1 | 17 |

**Doubts.** Both trees cover: whether I prayed (still in time, time over), an act of the prayer (before or after the next act; rukn or not; verses; correctness), the salām, a doubt after the salām, excessive doubters, imam and follower, recommended prayers, and the number of rakʿahs (invalid cases; leaning versus equal; each pair of numbers with the position that changes the answer: after the second sajdah, standing, and so on). Sistani's tree uses his nine valid cases (Issue 1185) and Khamenei's six (Rules 364, quoted from the official Urdu because the English is withheld, R11). Cases a marja's book does not address go to the pointer, not to a guess.
- **Where Khamenei has no counterpart, the helper does not offer the branch:** Sistani's Issues 1168, 1169, 1190 and the 4-or-6 and 3-or-5 cases. Those answers go to "another case", which points to his book.

**Wuḍūʾ.**
- **Sistani** (new rulings quoted: 301, 304, 305, which were added to the dataset for this): whether I performed wuḍūʾ (before, during, after the prayer), whether it became void (including the istibrāʾ exception), not knowing which came first, finding out afterwards, what invalidates it (his seven things, and the fluids: madhī, wadhī, wadī, istibrāʾ doubts, women), and excessive doubters.
- **Khamenei:** from his official Urdu treatise *Aḥkām-e Āmūzishī*, lesson 16 (P16, P19), and his Q&A: whether I performed wuḍūʾ (the treatise's before, during and after rules), doubt after performing (Q 122), finding out afterwards, excessive doubters, what invalidates it (his seven things from the treatise, plus Q 90, 91, 92 on fluids).
  - The treatise answers are **Urdu only**. Each result says *"No official English translation exists for this text… English readers can check it in his own risala or ask his office"*, with a link to his official site. The app does not translate it.

### Conflict check (P19): none found
- **Treatise against his Q&A and the 2023 Rules.** His 2023 *Rules* cover prayer and fasting only, so they have nothing on wuḍūʾ; the comparison was against his Q&A. No conflict with: Q 92 (madhī, wadhī and wadī are pure and do not invalidate wuḍūʾ, against the treatise's list of invalidators), Q 122 (no attention to a doubt after wuḍūʾ), and Q 136 (س 137, finding out afterwards that the wuḍūʾ was invalid). The other two treatise entries (the before/during/after rules for doubting whether one performed wuḍūʾ, and excessive doubters) have no Q&A counterpart to compare with.
- **Difference between maraji', not a conflict:** Khamenei's seventh invalidator is "everything that causes ghusl, such as janābah, ḥayḍ, touching a corpse" (stated as a ruling). Sistani gives janābah as a ruling and the rest "based on recommended precaution". Each is shown as that marja's own text.
- I did **not** compare the Urdu treatise with the Persian original *Risāla-yi Āmūzishī* (I stopped that crawl once the Urdu was the only text displayed and no English exists to disagree with). If you want the R11 Persian check applied to these four entries too, I can do it.

### Tests
- **Unit tests: 467 pass** (425 before; 42 new in `tests/wajibatDecisionTrees.test.ts`). For each of the four trees:
  - every one of the 262 root-to-answer paths ends at an answer;
  - "I'm not sure" on every question ends at the pointer;
  - **every quoted ruling is named by an option on the path it was reached by, and the last choice rests on a ruling the answer quotes** (P17c);
  - every quote is a verbatim part of that marja's own text, in Urdu where the English is withheld or does not exist;
  - questions contain no ruling language.
- Golden scenarios: Sistani's 3-or-4, 2-or-3 (after and before the second sajdah), 4-or-5 standing, leaning, two- and three-rakʿah prayers, time over, act before and after the next act; Khamenei's 3-or-4 (Urdu), 2-or-3 before the second sajdah, within time; wuḍūʾ during the prayer, sleep, Khamenei's Urdu-only text and his Q&A answer; and Makarem has none.
- **Validator:** new tree rules (unique ids, root, no cycles, no unreachable nodes, ≥2 options, a pointer behind every "I'm not sure", `basedOn` phrases present, quotes verbatim and from the same marja', verdict phrases present).
- **Generation:** `gen_helpers.py` fails with the full list of authoring errors if any quote or phrase is not found in the marja's own text. `build.py` now dumps the dataset twice (before and after the trees) and the source snapshot reports 0 problems.
- **Browser, Playwright against the production build:** `verify7.cjs` **87/87** at 1280, 768 and 390 px. It covers:
  - Sistani's and Khamenei's doubts helpers and both wuḍūʾ helpers;
  - Start, Back, Start over;
  - "I'm not sure" leading to the pointer, the Urdu-only label, the right-to-left quote, the highlight, and the label and marja's name on every result;
  - Makarem seeing no helper;
  - no horizontal scroll and no console errors.
- **Regression suites (same production build):** Taharat 37/37 (the wuḍūʾ card count updated from 24 to 29), Salat 35/35, offline/install 22/22, Phase 4a 34/34 (its Rules 364 check now expects the Urdu, since the English is withheld) and P18 30/30.

### Things to know
- **Sistani Issue 1154 prints "Sūrat al-Ḥamd00" in the source text** (a footnote marker that the official page leaves in). It is quoted exactly, so the "00" shows in one answer; the validator and snapshot require exact quotes. Known issue, not fixed (X1).
- **Five wuḍūʾ rulings were added** to the dataset and the wuḍūʾ topic, so the helpers have each marja's text to quote: Sistani's Issues 301, 304 and 305, and two rulings that pair Sistani's Issues 1251 and 298 with Khamenei's Urdu treatise (finding out afterwards that wuḍūʾ was invalid; excessive doubters). The topic now shows 29 rulings for Sistani (it showed 24).
- **"Where English readers can check"** points to the marja's official website and his risala, not to a specific istiftāʾ page: I did not verify an English istiftāʾ URL, so none is shown.
- **Reliability:** my reading of the 4b trees is checked by the tests and by exact-quote validation, but whether each *option leads to the right answer* is judged by me from his text. I recommend a scholar or second reader goes through the 262 paths, which the test enumerates, before release.
- **Install-size (R5):** the install-time download is **5,442.9 KiB** by my sum of the built precache entries (the last logged figure was 5,433.61 KiB, so about +9 KiB, which is the helper component; I could not recover the exact method of the earlier figure, so treat the difference as approximate). The ruling chunk grew from 1,191 KB to 1,308 KB (260 KB gzip) with the helpers and three rulings; it still downloads only when Fiqh is opened.

### Not done in this phase
- Makarem (no sources). Phase 9 (tracker) is deferred. Phases 5–8 and 10 are pending.

## Phase 4b follow-up: review round (2026-10-08)

Your seven points after the Phase 4b review. Decisions A1–A8 are in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### 1. Automated mismatch check (A1): run, 526 pending your decision
- **What:** for every ruling with more than one language version, it compares the **numbers, ordinal words and negation words**. It covers the English and Urdu of every dataset entry, English/Persian and Urdu/Persian for Khamenei's *Rules on Prayer & Fasting*, and the four Urdu treatise entries against the Persian treatise. 1,279 pairs compared.
- **Result:** **551 flagged** (340 high, 211 low). **25 are already decided** (rulings handled under R11, shown as `decided`). **526 are pending a person's decision** (321 high, 205 low).

  | Pair | High | Low |
  |---|---|---|
  | English / Urdu | 238 | 155 |
  | English / Persian | 53 | 22 |
  | Urdu / Persian | 30 | 28 |
- **High** = a number or ordinal appears on one side only, or a negation appears on one side only. **Low** = same values (or negation on both sides) but a different count, usually translation style.
- **Where to read it:** `wajibat_mismatch_report.md` (one table per severity, with a decision column). Statuses go in `tests/fixtures/wajibatMismatchDecisions.json`: `pending`, `accepted` (the versions say the same), `fix`, `withhold`, `decided`.
- **The test** (`tests/wajibatMismatch.test.ts`): the TypeScript check and the Python report must agree on every English/Urdu pair (so the fixture cannot go stale), and every reported mismatch must have a decision entry with a valid status; a new, unlisted mismatch fails the run. `pending` is a valid status, so the suite is green while your decisions are open.
- **What it cannot see (stated in the report):** a changed meaning with the same numbers and negations. **English 465 (the leisure-travel mistranslation) is not caught**: the Urdu also contains one negation. The two Khamenei slips that reading missed, 364 and 588, **are** caught (unit tests check both). So treat it as a net for slips, not proof that the other pairs agree.
- **Noise I tuned out, and what remains:**
  - Left out of the tables on purpose: "one"/ایک, "first"/پہلا/اول, and "second"/دوسرا/دوسری, because Urdu دوسری is usually "the other".
  - Reference numbers ("Ruling 413", "مسئلہ 413") are stripped, and the Arabic yeh and kaf are folded.
  - Persian negation matches verb prefixes (نکردن, نبودن, …).
  - A good share of what is left is still translation style: the English adds "fifty percent", Urdu uses "both" for "two", the Persian omits a word. That is why I did not auto-accept any of it.
- **A suggestion for deciding 526 rows:** start with the 53 + 30 Persian rows, since the Persian decides for Khamenei (R11); then the English/Urdu high rows for Sistani (where the English edition is newer and wins, P6, so those are mostly Urdu lag). I can sort the report by marja' and pair if that helps.

### 2. The four *Aḥkām-e Āmūzishī* entries against the Persian *Risāla-yi Āmūzishī* (A2): all agree
- Found the Persian treatise on leader.ir (book 137), read lesson 16 (مبطلات وضو, احکام وضو), and compared item by item:
  - the seven invalidators, including the seventh (everything that causes ghusl, such as janābah, ḥayḍ and touching a corpse);
  - finding out afterwards that the wuḍūʾ was invalid;
  - excessive doubters;
  - the three cases of doubt about whether wuḍūʾ was performed (before, during, after the prayer).
- **No difference.** Each entry now records the Persian passage as `persianSource` (metadata and the "Compared with the Persian original" caption; the Persian is never displayed), and the entries' note says so. The automated check also ran on these four pairs (Urdu against Persian); its remaining flag there is signal noise (the invalidators' "نہ" count against Persian verb forms).

### 3. Issue 1154 note on the helper answer (A3): done
The helper now shows the ruling entry's own note under a quote, as the ruling card does. For 1154 that is: *"Quoted exactly as published: the official page prints 'Sūrat al-Ḥamd00' (a typing slip on sistani.org, page 8298); the text is not corrected here."* The Urdu-only label is not repeated as a note. Any other entry note, such as the P5 "caution" notes, now shows on helper answers too.

### 4. Install-size script (A4): `npm run size`
- `scripts/measure-install-size.mjs` reads `.output/public/sw.js`, sums the real size of every file in the precache manifest (raw and gzip, KiB = 1024 bytes), and reports the Wajibat ruling chunk separately (it is deliberately not precached, R8). `--json` prints JSON.
- **Current build: 5,444.87 KiB raw (2,734.41 KiB gzip) across 240 precache files; ruling chunk 1,278.05 KiB (252.05 KiB gzip).**
- The earlier figures (5,433.61 and 5,442.9) came from other methods; **only figures from this script are comparable from now on.**

### 5. The transient test failure (A5): logged, not reproduced
- Once, `npm test` reported "27 failed (27), no tests" right after a Playwright run and a production build; the next run, seconds later, passed with no change. It has not recurred in about ten full runs since.
- Likely cause (not proven): the Vitest run overlapped a still-running build or Node process holding files. If it recurs, capture the first error line of the run before rerunning.

### 6. Review pack (A6): generated
- `node scripts/wajibat/review.mjs pack [--pdf]` writes `review_pack/<helper>.md`, `.html` and, with `--pdf`, `.pdf` for each of the four helpers (Sistani doubts 138 paths, Khamenei doubts 81, Sistani wuḍūʾ 26, Khamenei wuḍūʾ 17). Each has an index table (path id, the situation, the answer, tick boxes, notes), then every path in full:
  - each question and the answer chosen, and the ruling and phrase each option rests on;
  - the outcome quote with the answer phrase marked, its citation and official link, and any note shown with it;
  - **the official Urdu of the same ruling** where one exists, and the Urdu-only quote itself where there is no English;
  - a tick box ("OK" / "Changes needed") and a notes line.
- **How I read "Urdu and English":** the helper shows an English quote (Urdu where the English is withheld or does not exist), so the pack prints the matching official Urdu of the whole ruling next to the English quote for the Urdu reader. It does not translate anything.
- **Sign-off is stored per path in data:** `app/data/wajibat/treeReviews.json`, keyed by helper and path id, each record `{hash, status: approved | changes-needed, reviewer, date, note}`. The hash covers everything a reviewer sees on the path (questions, answers, quotes, citation basis). **If a path is edited after sign-off, the record no longer matches and the path counts as "changed since review".**
- Record sign-offs with `node scripts/wajibat/review.mjs approve <helper> --reviewer "Name" [--paths all|id,id|@file] [--status approved|changes-needed] [--note ...]`, and check them with `... status`.
- The PDFs need Playwright and Chromium (`PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=… node scripts/wajibat/review.mjs pack --pdf`); they are not a repo dependency. The packs are about 0.2–1 MB each.

### 7. Feature flag (A7): done
- **A helper is shown only when every one of its paths has a current approval,** or the dev flag is on: set `NUXT_PUBLIC_WAJIBAT_SHOW_UNREVIEWED_HELPERS=true` (runtime config `wajibatShowUnreviewedHelpers`, default false). Topic pages stay visible with all their rulings.
- **Today no path is signed off, so all four helpers are hidden in a normal build.**
- **Tests (new):** path ids unique and the 262-path total; stored sign-offs refer to real paths; an empty record hides the helper and the dev flag shows it; one missing path hides it; a "changes needed" path hides it; editing a path after sign-off makes it stale and hides it; the hash changes with any question, answer or outcome change.

### Tests and checks
- **Unit tests: 483 pass** (467 before): the mismatch suite (8) and the review/flag suite (8) are new. Lint is clean on every file touched.
- **Browser, production build:** helper suite **90/90** at 1280, 768 and 390 px with the dev flag on (87 before plus the Issue 1154 note check at each width); **flag off 9/9** (all four topic pages show their rulings and no helper); regressions Taharat 37/37, Salat 35/35, offline/install 22/22, Phase 4a 34/34, P18 30/30.
- **Source snapshot:** 0 problems after the treatise `persianSource` change.

## Mismatch triage, Playwright, production guard, merge preparation (2026-10-08)

Decisions B1–B4 are in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### Important: `main` already contains this work
`main` and `origin/main` were already at `c0a2190` (the review-round commit) when this round started: `wajibat-module` had been fast-forward merged into `main` and pushed between sessions (the reflog shows `merge wajibat-module: Fast-forward`; it was not done in this round). So Phases 1–4 and the review round are **already on `main`**. The helpers are hidden there (no sign-offs), but the 526 pending mismatch rows were not triaged on `main` until this round's commit. Nothing in this round was merged or pushed to `main`.

### B1. Safe-default triage (display only; nothing is accepted)
Rows by status, of 551 flagged:

| Status | Rows |
|---|---|
| `low-pending-review` (display unchanged) | 205 |
| `hidden-pending-review` (Sistani, high: Urdu hidden, English shown with a note) | 145 |
| `needs-human` (Khamenei, high, the Persian cannot decide; **shown as before**) | 118 |
| `persian-decided-pending-review` (Khamenei, high: the version matching the Persian is shown) | 58 |
| `decided` (already settled under R11) | 25 |

- **Hidden now:** Sistani **145 Urdu texts** (241 Sistani Urdu texts remain shown); Khamenei **7 Urdu texts and 22 English texts**. Per-topic counts are in `wajibat_mismatch_report.md` ("What is hidden now"); the topics with most hidden Sistani Urdu are Doubts in prayer (22), Sajdat al-sahw (13) and the precautionary prayer (10).
- **How Khamenei rows were decided:** each version's numbers and negations were compared with the Persian (Rules entries only). The version that matches is shown. If the English is the one that does not match but a guided-prayer step or a helper answer quotes it, the English was **not** hidden and the row is `needs-human` (16 rows); hiding it would have broken the step or the answer.
- **`needs-human` (118 rows, 81 rulings, 64 with an English/Urdu difference)** are in `wajibat_needs_human.md`, **English/Urdu first, both texts side by side** (the Persian too where there is one). Reasons: no Persian to decide with (Q&A answers and the Urdu-only treatise): 50 rows; neither version matches the Persian: 52; the hold would break a step or helper quote: 16.
- **How it works:** `triage_mismatch.py` sets the statuses; `holds.py` applies them when the data is generated; `build.py` generates twice (pass 1 full data for the comparison, pass 2 with the holds). A person's decisions are never overwritten. **Restoring a hidden text is a recorded decision** with reviewer and date: `python scripts/wajibat/decide_mismatch.py --ruling ID --status restored --reviewer "Name"`, then `build.py`.
- **Display:** a held Sistani Urdu shows the existing "no official Urdu yet, so the English is shown" line plus the note that it is held for a person's check. A held Khamenei English shows its own notice ("an automated comparison found a difference… only the official Urdu is shown until a person has checked it"). Neither claims the other version is wrong.
- **Tests:** the mismatch tests now include the triage rules (nothing auto-accepted, Sistani high rows hide the Urdu, one hold per ruling, the shipped data follows the holds, a restored row has no hold and a reviewer). Counts in the older dataset tests were made to follow the holds.

### B2. Playwright
Added as a devDependency (`playwright` ^1.64); after `npm install`, run `npx playwright install chromium` once. The review pack PDFs were regenerated with it. Documented in `scripts/wajibat/README.md`.

### B3. Production guard
`app/utils/wajibatBuildGuard.ts`, called from `nuxt.config.ts`: **a production build (`NODE_ENV=production` or `VERCEL_ENV=production`) now fails if `NUXT_PUBLIC_WAJIBAT_SHOW_UNREVIEWED_HELPERS` is on** (true/1/yes/on). Tested for real: `NUXT_PUBLIC_WAJIBAT_SHOW_UNREVIEWED_HELPERS=true npx nuxt build` stops with the error. Four unit tests cover the spellings, production without the flag, development, and that `nuxt.config.ts` calls it.

### B4. Merge preparation
See `wajibat_release_notes.md` and the plan given to the user. **Not merged**, as `main` already holds the earlier commits; only this round's new commit would go to `main`, after the user's go-ahead.

### Checks
- Unit tests: **see the final count in the last line of this section**. Lint is clean on every file touched.
- Browser (production build): helper suite 90/90 (flag on); flag off: helpers hidden on all four topic pages; regressions Taharat 37/37, Salat 35/35, offline/install 22/22, Phase 4a 34/34, P18 30/30 (two assertions updated, because the English of Rules 388 is now held back); a Sistani held-Urdu check passes.
- **One transient browser error seen once:** "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" on one page load during the regression run (the chunk was present and served 200 afterwards; a rerun was clean). Logged with the transient `npm test` failure; investigate if it recurs.
- Install size from `npm run size`: **5,445.42 KiB raw (2,734.53 KiB gzip)**, 240 precache files; ruling chunk 1,190.17 KiB (228.96 KiB gzip), down from 1,278.05 KiB because of the hidden texts.
- **Unit tests: 492 pass** (483 before: 5 triage/hold tests and 4 build-guard tests are new).

## Pre-merge blocker: held English in steps and helper answers; extractor; chunk reload (2026-10-08)

Decisions C1–C4 are in `wajibat_decisions.md`.

### C1. The 16 `needs-human` rows (8 rulings)
The 16 rows were **8 rulings** (two rows each, English/Persian and English/Urdu), all Khamenei's, where the Urdu matches the Persian and the English does not, and the English was quoted by something:

| | Rulings |
|---|---|
| **Helper answers (7)** | `doubtprayeritself`, `doubtimam`, `doubtsdismissedlist`, `doubtrepeated`, `doubtaftersalaminvalid`, `doubtsupposition`, `excessiveact` (9 answer screens in Khamenei's doubts helper) |
| **Guided-prayer steps (1 ruling, 3 steps)** | `thirdfourthrakah` (the third and fourth rakʿah dhikr) in Khamenei's maghrib (step 19) and ẓuhr (steps 19 and 26) prayers |

In all eight the Urdu matches the Persian, so none needed the "refer to his risala" pointer.
- **Helper answers** now quote the official Urdu of those rulings (verbatim cuts, with Urdu answer phrases highlighted). The helper shows a notice that the English is held for a person's check and the Urdu is shown meanwhile.
- **Guided-prayer steps** carry a verbatim Urdu excerpt of the same ruling, which the step shows (English and Urdu mode alike) with the same notice and its citation.
- **Wording:** I did not use the P19 label "no official English translation", because an official English text exists; the notice says the English is held until a person has checked it. The pattern is the P19 one.
- **Safety:** a hold on English that a step or helper answer quotes now fails the build unless an Urdu counterpart is registered (`holds.py`: `HELD_EN_STEP_CUTS`, `HELD_EN_TREE_URDU`); the helper generator refuses to quote withheld English, and the validator requires an Urdu excerpt on any step whose English is withheld.
- **Tests:** a step on held English carries a verbatim Urdu excerpt; helper answers on the eight rulings quote Urdu; browser: `verify10` (guided prayers, English and Urdu mode at 1280, 768, 390 px) 15/15; the helper suite (90/90) and the earlier suites pass.

### C2. The 52 "match neither" rows were mostly extraction, not errors
Causes found, all on the comparison side (the rulings were not wrong):
- **Persian footnote markers read as numbers**: "(1)" and bare "1" after a word ("واجب 1 است", "جهریّه 1 زیاد").
- **List markers not stripped**: English "1- ", Urdu inline "1۔ نیت؛ 2۔ قیام".
- **Persian negations not recognised**: verb forms such as نباشد, نداند, نتواند.
- **Number words missing**: Persian هفده, Urdu سترہ, English eighteen/seventeen.

After fixing the extractor (shared word tables; the TypeScript twin follows; parity test passes): **"match neither" 52 rows → 20 rows**; `needs-human` 118 → **70 rows (58 items)**: 50 with no Persian to compare, 20 where neither version matches. The remaining 20 look like real differences or translation style (for example English "either side" against Persian "دو طرف"); they stay for a person.

**Display decisions that changed because of the extractor fix** (compared with the committed triage; nothing else changed without a recorded reason):
- **English restored (2):** `elevencomponents` and `rukns` (Khamenei): their English had been hidden because the Persian list numbers were misread; both versions now match the Persian, so no hold.
- **Held version flipped (1):** `goldjewellerymen` (Khamenei): the English was shown and the Urdu hidden; now the Urdu matches the Persian and the English does not (a negation), so the **English is held and the Urdu shown**.
- **New holds from the corrected comparison (4):** `followerahead`, `mubtilatlist`, `obligatoryprayers` (Khamenei, Urdu hidden: the Persian decides; they were `needs-human`), and `adhanwording` (**Sistani**, Urdu hidden: the Urdu lacks the iqamah count that the English 4th edition has, which is a real difference).
- **Plus the 8 rulings of C1** (English held, Urdu shown).

Totals now: **Sistani Urdu hidden 146 rulings (240 Sistani Urdu texts remain); Khamenei Urdu hidden 9, English held 29**; hold rulings 184 (was 174).

### C3. Chunk-load errors
`emitRouteChunkError: "automatic"` is now set explicitly in `nuxt.config.ts` (Nuxt 4.2.2). A failed route-chunk load during navigation after a deploy reloads the page instead of showing an error. (Nuxt 4's default is already "automatic"; it is explicit so the behaviour is deliberate, and a test checks it.) It covers navigation errors; a chunk that fails during the very first page load of an old tab is not a route-navigation error, and "automatic-immediate" would be the setting that reloads on those too (not enabled; ask if you want it).

### C4. Checks
- Unit tests **495 pass** (492 before). Lint clean on the files touched.
- Browser (production build): helper suite **90/90**, flag-off 9/9, held-English guided prayers **15/15** (3 widths, English and Urdu mode), regressions Taharat 37/37, Salat 35/35, offline/install 22/22, Phase 4a 34/34, P18 30/30.
- Install size (`npm run size`): **5,447.11 KiB raw (2,734.49 KiB gzip)**; ruling chunk 1,190.62 KiB (228.7 KiB gzip).

## The 20 "match neither" rows held for review (2026-10-08)

Decisions D1–D2 are in `wajibat_decisions.md`.
- **The 20 rows were 8 rulings, all Khamenei's** (none is Sistani's, so no Sistani Urdu was newly held): `ayatcauses`, `doubtkinds`, `fridaybest`, `maghribishatime`, `quransajdah`, `tashahhudforgot`, `turningface`, `zuhrasrtime`. Neither his English nor his Urdu matches the Persian on a number or a negation.
- **Recorded** with `decide_mismatch.py` (new: `--status held-pending-review --hold refer`, repeated `--key`), reviewer and date in `wajibatMismatchDecisions.json`. The triage never overwrites it.
- **Display:** a held ruling's card shows no English or Urdu, only: *held for review… please read it in his own book: The Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023, issue N, official text* (with the official link). New entry field `referToRisala` (`holds.py`). The validator refuses a step or helper quote of a held ruling; none quotes any of them (checked by tests).
- **Counts now:** `held-pending-review` 20 rows (8 rulings); `needs-human` **50 rows** (all Khamenei Q&A answers with no Persian original). Holds: Sistani Urdu hidden 146; Khamenei Urdu hidden 9, English held 29, pointer 8.
- **Restoring** one is the same recorded-decision path (`--status restored`).
- **`emitRouteChunkError` stays `"automatic"`**: no immediate reloads mid-reading.
- **Checks:** unit tests **496 pass**; browser (production build): new held-pointer check **8/8** (all 8 rulings, English and Urdu mode, 1280 and 390 px, Sistani unaffected), guided prayers 15/15, flag-off 9/9, and the helper suite and the earlier suites (see below); install size **5,447.89 KiB raw (2,735.02 KiB gzip)**, ruling chunk 1,192.68 KiB.


## Phase 5 — Sawm (fasting) and zakāt al-fiṭrah (2026-10-08)

Working decisions E1–E9 are in `wajibat_decisions.md` ("Phase 5 working decisions"). **Not merged.** Everything is on `wajibat-module`.

### What was built
- **13 topics** in the Fasting category, **341 rulings**: Sistani **233** entries, Khamenei **195** entries from *The Rules on Prayer & Fasting 2023* (every ruling 787–981) and **41** Q&A supplementary entries (R7).
- **Sistani:** *Islamic Laws* Chapter Four, Fasting, Rulings **1529–1718** (190) and zakāt al-fiṭrah **2003–2044** (42). Ruling 1662 is quoted as two verbatim excerpts, one per point. The chapter's one-line opening definition has footnote markers in the middle of the sentence, so it is not quoted.
- **Khamenei:** all 195 rulings of the fasting chapter, each with the official Urdu (book 197) and the Persian original (book 180) read against it. His *iʿtikāf* rulings (982–1009) are left for later (E1).
- **Urdu:** 178 of Sistani's 233 entries have Urdu in the dataset: the 7 revised (*) rulings have none, because the older Urdu edition lags (1537, 1542, 1562, 1584, 1694, 1699, 2016: each compared with the Urdu one by one, P6); the 2 excerpts of 1662 have none; and 48 more are held by the mismatch triage (below). Khamenei: 186 of 195 Rules entries and all 41 Q&As have Urdu in the data.

| Topic | Rulings | Sistani | Khamenei (Rules) | Khamenei Q&A |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Who must fast (`sawmwho`) | 6 | 3 | 5 | 0 |
| Illness, harm, old age, pregnancy and breastfeeding (`sawmexempt`) | 20 | 10 | 11 | 7 |
| The intention for the fast (`sawmniyyah`) | 23 | 18 | 17 | 1 |
| What invalidates the fast (`sawmmubtilat`) | 75 | 50 | 47 | 13 |
| Janābah, ḥayḍ and nifās and the fast (`sawmjanabah`) | 30 | 25 | 16 | 2 |
| Dawn, maghrib and breaking the fast (`sawmtimes`) | 7 | 5 | 7 | 0 |
| Kaffārah for breaking the fast (`sawmkaffarah`) | 39 | 28 | 22 | 5 |
| When only qaḍāʾ is due (`sawmonlyqada`) | 8 | 4 | 5 | 1 |
| Making up missed fasts (qaḍāʾ) and the fidyah (`sawmqada`) | 33 | 21 | 24 | 2 |
| Fasting and travel (`sawmtravel`) | 21 | 11 | 18 | 1 |
| Establishing the first of the month (`sawmmonth`) | 23 | 8 | 13 | 9 |
| Obligatory, forbidden, disapproved and recommended fasts (`sawmtypes`) | 14 | 8 | 10 | 0 |
| Zakāt al-fiṭrah (`zakatfitrah`) | 42 | 42 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **341** | **233** | **195** | **41** |

- **Pairing.** Each ruling pairs a Sistani and a Khamenei ruling on the same point under a short app-written heading. Where only one book states a point, the other marja' sees "has not been added yet", or, where his book states it inside another ruling of the same topic, a pointer to it (`seeAlso`). The women-specific rulings (ḥayḍ, nifās, pregnancy, breastfeeding, girls who have just reached bulūgh) are collapsed under "Rulings specific to women" (Q8). Rulings where the two books clearly differ are flagged "maraji' differ": the intention when one forgets it is Ramadan, injections, immersing the head in water, remaining junub on purpose, the two months of consecutive fasting, several invalidators in one day, old age, a sick person who recovers during the day, and how the first of the month is established.
- **Dawn and maghrib.** The "Dawn, maghrib and breaking the fast" topic shows today's dawn and maghrib exactly as the Prayer Times feature has them (nothing recomputed), with buttons to Prayer Times and to the Ramadan fasting log (Module 11). No second fasting log was built. The panel says the rulings below decide when the fast begins and ends.
- **Qur'anic basis (R2).** 2:183 and 2:185 on "Who must fast"; 2:185 on the exemptions, travel and qaḍāʾ; 2:187 on dawn and maghrib and on what invalidates the fast. Each ayah's own words name fasting.
- **Glossary:** 13 new terms from Sistani's glossary (ṣawm, kaffārah, fidyah, mudd, ṣāʿ, ifṭār, faqīr, rajāʾ, mā fī al-dhimmah, maghrib, ḥadd al-tarakhkhuṣ, nadhr, zakāt al-fiṭrah), cut verbatim by the generator.
- **A topic where a marja' has nothing** shows one notice instead of a card per ruling. Today that is only zakāt al-fiṭrah for Khamenei (E3).
- **Q&A supplementary entries (R7, P13).** 41 entries from the Fasting chapter of the Q&A book (English Q 741–846, Urdu س 745–850), each compared with the Rules ruling it agrees with and shown to Khamenei's followers only. All 102 supplementary entries (61 prayer + 41 fasting) were checked word for word against the live leader.ir pages: 0 mismatches. The 65 Q&As not added are listed at the end of this section.

### Things found and fixed on the way
1. **The Persian original numbers the fasting chapter differently** from the English and the official Urdu (E7): English 880 is Persian 902, and the Persian runs +1 from 881 to 900. Without this, the first build flagged 57 rows as "neither version matches the Persian"; after the fix 29 remained (the rest were comparisons against the wrong Persian ruling).
2. **A footnote bug.** One footnote block holding two notes ("[1] … [2] …") was attached whole to the first ruling: Khamenei 879's Urdu carried the footnote of 883 (vow kaffārah). Fixed; no ruling of an earlier phase was affected.
3. **False positives in the extractor** (the same kind as C2): the English glosses *mudd* as "750 gm." where the Persian and Urdu say only "one mudd" (weights in grams are now stripped); Persian نُه ("nine") was read as a negation; the numbers 60–90 and Persian ordinals 11–20 were missing. I first added Urdu اسی and ستر as 80 and 70, then took them out: they also mean "this very" and "covering", and they changed 56 rows of earlier rulings (all false flags).
4. **One earlier display decision changed, and no other:** Sistani **Ruling 866** (moving vehicles, "ninety degrees" against the Urdu ۹۰): its Urdu had been held because the English word was not recognised as a number. The corrected check finds no difference, so its Urdu is shown again. No human decision was touched; I checked every earlier row against the committed decisions file before and after.

### Mismatch triage of the new rulings (decision B1, applied automatically)
Nothing was accepted. The safe default decided what is displayed:

| | Rulings |
|---|---|
| **Sistani Urdu held** (`hidden-pending-review`): English shown with the Urdu notice | **48** |
| **Khamenei, Persian decides** (`persian-decided-pending-review`) | **21**: the Urdu held for 9 (English shown), the English held for 12 (the official Urdu shown, with the notice) |
| **Needs a person** (`needs-human`), shown as before | **13** Rules rulings (neither version matches the Persian, or the Persian has no counterpart for a number) and **13** Q&A answers (no Persian original) |
| Low (`low-pending-review`), display unchanged | 59 Rules + 22 Q&A + 46 Sistani |

Totals now: Sistani Urdu held for **193** rulings; Khamenei Urdu held for **18**, English held for **41**, pointer to his book for **8** (unchanged); `needs-human` **92 rows**. The new rows are listed in `wajibat_needs_human.md` (English/Urdu first) and `wajibat_mismatch_report.md`. **Most of the new Khamenei flags look like translation style** (an English "remains obligatory" against the Persian and Urdu "is not waived"; "allowed" against "no problem"); the check cannot tell that from a changed meaning, so the safe default hides one version until a person decides.

### Not done / needs the user
- **Zakāt al-fiṭrah for Khamenei:** no source found (E3). Do you have one?
- **The 13 Khamenei rulings in the "match neither" class:** shown as before; D1 held the earlier 8 with a pointer to his book. Hold these the same way? (E9). They are `sawmdoubtday`, `sawmforced`, `sawmgirls`, `sawmintentrecommended`, `sawmjunubsleepsecond`, `sawmkaffvow`, `sawmqadaable`, `sawmqadacount`, `sawmqadaillness`, `sawmqadaparentspurpose`, `sawmrecommended`, `sawmtravelplaces`, `sawmtravelunawareshari`.
- **iʿtikāf** (Sistani Chapter Five, Khamenei 982–1009): not in Sawm in the spec; suggest Phase 8.
- **The 262 helper paths** are still unsigned, so the helpers stay hidden. Phase 5 adds no helper.
- **Reviewer sign-off** of the new content: still "Not scholar-reviewed" on every page.
- **Makarem Shirazi:** unchanged (no sources).

### Checks
- **Unit tests: 509 pass** (496 before). New `tests/wajibatSawm.test.ts` (13 tests): every Sistani ruling of 1529–1718 and 2003–2044 and every Khamenei ruling of 787–981 is quoted (1662 as two excerpts, nothing else twice); the Urdu and Persian numbers pair as designed (including 880 = Persian 902 and the 881–900 shift); Khamenei 879/883's Urdu footnotes sit on the right ruling; the seven revised (*) Sistani rulings have no Urdu; zakāt al-fiṭrah has 42 Sistani entries and none for Khamenei; every `seeAlso` target is in the same topic and has the marja's entry; "maraji' differ" only where both have an entry; women-specific rulings are collapsed; Qur'anic basis; search; and the 41 Q&A entries (own Q numbers, Urdu = English + 4, agreesWith a fasting Rule, hidden from Sistani). The older Khamenei-Rules test now expects 395 entries (200 + 195).
- **Source snapshot:** 0 problems; every one of the 2,539 numbered quotes matches its official unit exactly. **102 supplementary Q&A entries** (61 prayer + 41 fasting) checked word for word against the live leader.ir pages: 0 mismatches.
- **Lint** is clean on every file touched.
- **Browser, Playwright against the production build:**
  - **Phase 5 suite 372/372:** the category page lists 13 topics; every one of the 13 topics for both maraji', in English and Urdu, at 1280 and 390 px: the number of ruling cards equals what the dataset says that marja' should see, no horizontal overflow, the women's panel shows the right count, and no console or page errors; Khamenei sees his Q&A (for example Q 763 on injections) and Sistani does not; Khamenei's zakāt al-fiṭrah shows the single notice and no cards; the dawn and maghrib panel and its two links; Qur'anic basis cards; hub search finds zakāt al-fiṭrah.
  - **Regression 401/401:** all 33 topics of the earlier categories for both maraji' (English at 1280, Urdu at 390): card counts, no overflow, helpers hidden, no errors, and a held ruling still shows only the pointer.
  - **Flag on/off 8/8:** with `NUXT_PUBLIC_WAJIBAT_SHOW_UNREVIEWED_HELPERS=true` the doubts and wuḍūʾ helpers show for both maraji'; without it they stay hidden.
  - I could not re-run my earlier browser scripts (they were not kept in the working folder), so the regression above is a fresh, broader equivalent; the 90-check helper suite was **not** re-run. The helpers are untouched and the unit tests that walk all 262 paths pass.
  - One environmental message is ignored in the console check: the production build asks for `/_vercel/insights/script.js`, which only exists on Vercel.
- **One earlier-topic display change from the new notice:** Khamenei's followers on the one-ruling *ahkam* topic now see "No rulings from Ayatollah Khamenei have been added to this topic yet" instead of one "has not been added yet" card. Same meaning, one element.
- **Install size (`npm run size`, R5):** the install-time precache is **5,450.26 KiB raw (2,735.06 KiB gzip)**, 240 files: +2.4 KiB from 5,447.89, because the ruling data stays out of the precache by design (R8). The ruling chunk grew from 1,192.68 KiB (about 229 KiB gzip) to **1,774.71 KiB raw (334.97 KiB gzip)**; it is loaded when `/fiqh` is opened and cached at runtime.

### The 65 Q&As of the Fasting chapter that were not added (E4)
Not added in this pass, mostly because there is no single Rules ruling to cite as the one the answer agrees with, or because the answer covers several points. I did not check each of these for agreement, and none has been judged wrong. Say if you want any added.

## Phase 5 approved: holds, browser suites in the repo, per-category data chunks (2026-10-09)

Decisions F1–F6 are in `wajibat_decisions.md`. Phase 5 itself is unchanged except for the 13 holds below. Everything is on `wajibat-module`; **not merged**.

### 1–4. Decisions recorded
- **F1** zakāt al-fiṭrah (Khamenei): the notice stays; Phase 6 searches his Persian Q&A on leader.ir and the zakāt chapter of his Urdu Q&A book.
- **F2** the 13 "neither matches the Persian" fasting rulings are **held with the pointer to his book**, recorded with `decide_mismatch.py` (`held-pending-review`, `--hold refer`, reviewer Syed Hassan Raza). Only their high-priority rows (28) are held; their 3 low rows were put back to `low-pending-review`, because the held rule is "high rows only" (a test enforces it). The ruling card shows no text, only the pointer to the *Rules* ruling. Totals now: **21 rulings held with a pointer** (8 + 13); `held-pending-review` 48 rows; `needs-human` **64 rows** (Khamenei Q&A answers with no Persian original); Sistani Urdu held 193; Khamenei Urdu held 18, English held 41. No step or helper answer quotes a held ruling (a test checks it).
- **F3** iʿtikāf: Phase 8, low priority. **F4** the 65 unadded Q&A answers: skipped; from now on only Q&A answers that cover a point his Rules do not.

### 5. Browser suites are in the repo: `npm run test:e2e:wajibat`
- `tests/e2e/wajibat/` holds seven suites and a runner (`run.mjs`): it builds the app (unless `--skip-build`), starts the production server twice (helpers hidden on one port; the dev flag on another, for the helper walk only), runs the suites, prints the results and the chunk sizes, and stops the servers. `--suite a,b` runs some. Expected counts come from the app's own data, never from numbers typed into the tests. See `tests/e2e/wajibat/README.md`.
- **Honest note:** my earlier browser scripts (the 90-check helper suite, Taharat 37, Salat 35, offline 22, Phase 4a 34, P18 30, guided prayers 15, held-pointer 8 and flag checks) were never committed; they lived only in my temporary working folder and are no longer there, so I could not re-run them. I wrote **new, broader suites for the same areas** instead and ran them from the repo. They do not reproduce the old check counts one for one.
- **Results from the repo (one run against one production build): 2,812 checks, 0 failed.**

| Suite | Checks | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `categories` | 769 | all 46 topics, both maraji', English at 1280 px and Urdu at 390 px: card counts, women's panel, "nothing yet" notice, overflow, helpers hidden, no errors; hub and category pages (replaces the Taharat, Salat and Phase 4a/P18 page checks) |
| `sawm` | 17 | Phase 5 specifics |
| `holds` | 95 | all 21 pointer rulings, held Sistani Urdu, held Khamenei English, nothing leaking to the other marja' |
| `guided` | 383 | every step of all 11 guided prayers and ablutions, held-English steps shown in Urdu |
| `helpers` | 1,530 | **all 262 paths of the 4 helpers** walked through the UI (138 + 81 + 26 + 17): "I'm not sure" on every question, every answer verbatim or a pointer, hidden with the flag off |
| `chunks` | 7 | which data chunk each page downloads |
| `offline` | 11 | see below |

  Two failures in my own first runs of the suites were mistakes in the tests, fixed before the final run: a regular expression whose backslashes my shell had stripped, and a check that looked for the women's-panel cards before the panel was opened.

### 6. Data split per category
- **What changed.** The app no longer imports the whole dataset. `app/data/wajibat/runtime.ts` holds a small core (categories, topics, glossary, a one-line index of every ruling for search) and loads each category's rulings, procedures, recitations and helpers from its own chunk, on demand. `index.ts` stays the full dataset for the unit tests and the generators only. A topic page loads its category's chunk before it renders, on the server and in the browser. The hub search runs on the ruling index, so it needs no category chunk.
- **Generated:** `decisionTrees/<category>.ts` (written by `gen_helpers.py`) and `rulingIndex.ts` (new `gen_index.py`); `build.py` runs both. Nothing is hand-edited.
- **Chunk sizes, per category** (from the build; the unsplit file was 1,774.71 KiB raw / 334.97 KiB gzip):

| Chunk | Raw KiB | Gzip KiB |
|---|---|---|
| core (always) | 148.93 | 34.70 |
| Foundations | 36.21 | 10.44 |
| Ṭahārah (with the wuḍūʾ helpers and 5 ablution guides) | 294.90 | 65.96 |
| Ṣalāt (rulings, doubts, Q&A, guided prayers, recitations, doubts helpers) | 813.67 | 143.10 |
| Ṣawm (with Khamenei's Q&A) | 568.02 | 102.76 |
| all five | 1,861.73 | 357.0 |

  A visit downloads the core plus one category: at most **962.6 KiB raw (177.8 KiB gzip)** for Ṣalāt, **717 KiB** for Ṣawm, **443 KiB** for Ṭahārah, 185 KiB for Foundations; the hub alone loads only the core. The sum is 87 KiB larger than the single file because each chunk repeats a little module overhead.
- **Install-time download** (`npm run size`): 5,452.07 KiB raw (2,736.26 KiB gzip), +1.8 KiB. The data chunks stay out of the precache by design (R8).
- **Offline ("Save all for offline"), checked in the browser:**
  - visiting one category caches the core and that category only (Sawm: `core, sawm`);
  - the hub button loads every category, caches **all five chunks** and records the build id and chunk URLs; after a reload the hub shows "Saved for offline" again; a copy from an older build does not count;
  - older copies of a chunk are pruned only when the same chunk exists under a new hash, so opening one category never deletes another's cache;
  - with the network cut, in a second tab that has loaded only the core, one topic of **each of the four categories renders its cards from the cache**, and search works.
- **Known limit, unchanged:** the app shell itself is not precached for a hard navigation, so offline reading means moving around inside an open app (as before). A fresh tab opened while offline still fails to load.
- **Tests:** 513 unit tests pass (509 before). New `tests/wajibatChunks.test.ts`: the four chunks together hold exactly the full dataset; every ruling, procedure and helper sits in the chunk of its topic's category; every cross-reference (`seeAlso`, procedure steps, helper quotes, topic ruling lists) stays inside one chunk; the ruling index matches the data and gives the same search results as the full data.
